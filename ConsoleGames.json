You no longer have to fantasize about being a goat, your dreams have finally come true! \r\n\r\nGameplay-wise, Goat Simulator is all about causing as much destruction as you possibly can as a goat. It has been compared to an old-school skating game, except instead of being a skater, you're a goat, and instead of doing tricks, you wreck stuff. Destroy things with style, such as doing a backflip while headbutting a bucket through a window, and you'll earn even more points! When it comes to goats, not even the sky is the limit, as you can probably just bug through it and crash the game.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer\r\nGoat Simulator is a completely stupid game and, to be honest, you should probably spend your money on something else, such as a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a real goat.\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n• You can be a goat \r\n• Get points for wrecking stuff - brag to your friends that you're the alpha goat \r\n• MILLIONS OF BUGS!

As an unpaid intern in the dystopian city of Neo-Cascadia, you’ll wield office junk as weaponry as you make your way through the offbeat procedural dungeons beneath your company campus.\r\n\r\n[The Future is Wack]\r\nFailed businesses no longer just cease to exist--they sink beneath the earth, and their employees are cursed to wander the halls for eternity as monsters. It’s your duty to put these monsters out of their misery and repossess their assets--so that your boss can afford a new car, or something.\r\n\r\n[Not All Heroes Get Paychecks]\r\nBattle through the remains of failed startups themed off of gig workers, dating sites, and cryptocurrency. Uncover the true motives of your employer, a carbonated drink startup known as Fizzle, and their parent company, a subscription box manufacturer with an army of helpful shipping drones. Make friends with your co-workers! Hire a freelance goblin! Date a slime! Invest in crypto! Set a rideshare on fire!\r\n\r\n[Fight Flexibly]\r\nIn the dungeons of Going Under, almost everything can be used as a weapon, from laptops to brooms to body pillows. Proper weapons can be found as well, but even they can break at a moment’s notice if you aren’t careful. Playing cautiously and picking the right weapon for the situation are musts if you intend on surviving your internship.\r\n\r\n[Horrible Bosses]\r\nAnd you thought your boss was a monster.

A mysterious and unstoppable force threatens the galaxy. The Spartans of Fireteam Osiris and Blue Team must embark on a journey that will change the course of history and the future of mankind.\r\n\r\nWARZONE MULTIPLAYER\r\nPlay with friends and compete against rivals in three massive multiplayer modes new to the Halo franchise: Warzone, Warzone Assault, and Warzone Firefight. \r\n\r\n-WARZONE is a massive-scale multiplayer mode that supports 24-player battles with both friendly and enemy AI constantly dropping in to mix up the experience. \r\n\r\n-In WARZONE ASSAULT, it’s 24-player attack-and-defend with the attacking team looking to overrun strategic objectives while the opposing force works to stop the onslaught. \r\n\r\n-WARZONE FIREFIGHT is an ambitious new multiplayer experience that delivers the biggest Halo cooperative experience in franchise history. Up to eight players work together to complete five rounds of increasingly difficult, dynamic objectives set against a timer to emerge victorious.\r\n\r\nARENA MULTIPLAYER\r\nHalo 5’s Arena multiplayer continues the established franchise legacy of pure, skill-based 4v4 competitive combat. Multiple Arena modes provide endless ways to play and compete, from classic Slayer and Capture The Flag modes, to popular social modes like Infection, Grifball, and the all-new Super Fiesta.\r\n\r\nFORGE\r\nFor years, Halo’s Forge mode has empowered Halo fans to create new maps and game modes that have changed the way people play and experience Halo. Download new levels from the Forge community created on either Windows (using “Halo 5: Forge” for Windows 10) or Xbox One. Customize existing maps or create your own from scratch. Browse, find, and play an endless array of custom games created and hosted by the community.\r\n\r\nREQ SYSTEM\r\nNew to Halo 5: Guardians is the Requisition System (REQ System), which rewards players for their time spent in Halo 5’s multiplayer modes.

Find relics inside Vaults to increase Breaker's ability to survive and fight on this godforsaken galaxy.\r\n\r\n# ANVIL\r\nAncient Vault Investigation Lab\r\nANVIL is an agency that searches for \"Vaults”, the remnants of alien civilizations scattered throughout the universe. Become a \"Breaker\" searching for “Vaults” and explore the unknown galaxy. Each galaxy consists of random planets and unique boss monsters. By defeating monsters and opening the Vaults, you will be able to utilize the stunning powers within.\r\n\r\n# Breakers\r\nThe Breakers are the seekers of Vaults. They have maximized their combat capabilities to survive various threats that they may encounter on different planets. Breakers with unique abilities and skills are waiting to be selected.\r\n\r\n# Artifacts and Vault Weapons\r\nOver 100 randomly generated artifacts and dozens of weapons will make every session unique and different from previous sessions. You will be able to explore a combination of different playstyles by testing synergy between various artifacts and obtain powerful weapons to get the “ultimate” Breaker!\r\n\r\n# Death and Rebirth\r\nThe Breakers enter combat with their mechanical body. They are rebuilt in ANVIL if they are destroyed during an exploration. Your Breakers will gain EXP during battle that will enhance their strength and give them new powers. The Breakers are not afraid of death because death only makes them stronger when they are rebuilt.\r\n\r\nFull details on the latest status of the game, how you can give feedback and report issues can be found at www.anvil.world."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"anvil-vault-breaker-game-preview","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":0,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30434.14277836659846754.1096f7d8-d613-4743-803e-2ebeca442db7.f04dcee7-9d65-454a-bc60-f15fe2954a81","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":false,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":false,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11581.14277836659846754.1096f7d8-d613-4743-803e-2ebeca442db7.e13c5b6f-d326-489d-9d19-2536310b2127","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40587.14277836659846754.1096f7d8-d613-4743-803e-2ebeca442db7.58e48d47-e310-41fc-b94d-8c9a99c6b234","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18758.14277836659846754.1096f7d8-d613-4743-803e-2ebeca442db7.042b454a-20d7-4f04-b876-52af3d0cbb4c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63689.14277836659846754.1096f7d8-d613-4743-803e-2ebeca442db7.a51a37b8-c40d-481e-9438-4af6389ea555","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1004.14277836659846754.1096f7d8-d613-4743-803e-2ebeca442db7.e9fa3d12-3a3a-48dc-94f7-ba48ce36668c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40932.14277836659846754.1096f7d8-d613-4743-803e-2ebeca442db7.56e008c0-35b8-4c35-9fc2-bdda37bb8cca","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.65034.14277836659846754.1096f7d8-d613-4743-803e-2ebeca442db7.62796cf6-4b38-4c83-ad6e-151bae7daa36","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1972.14277836659846754.1096f7d8-d613-4743-803e-2ebeca442db7.cda3b257-d9ca-4761-94cd-c72a51521256","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9996.14277836659846754.1096f7d8-d613-4743-803e-2ebeca442db7.3244f300-2ccc-4931-9de0-cfebfb026a7c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53295.14277836659846754.1096f7d8-d613-4743-803e-2ebeca442db7.e7f7ff24-e323-4650-8643-76fc9c5023e0","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48772.14277836659846754.1096f7d8-d613-4743-803e-2ebeca442db7.48d25dd0-5b15-4d18-8277-6fd876d53de0","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12822.14277836659846754.1096f7d8-d613-4743-803e-2ebeca442db7.66f2f3cd-0f2e-4f73-85cf-f2097c300e2d","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40194.14277836659846754.1096f7d8-d613-4743-803e-2ebeca442db7.fb5b33d3-506d-4f72-a6f0-47ca63a81df0","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46464.14277836659846754.1096f7d8-d613-4743-803e-2ebeca442db7.0a01abe6-35ec-4306-92a9-f05db20fba3d","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29393.14277836659846754.1096f7d8-d613-4743-803e-2ebeca442db7.857e92f6-033d-47ba-9cf7-78e7212f26d6"],"ReleaseDate":5249418314427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":7122907136}},{"Categories":["Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-series-x/aragami-2/"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":74},"ID":"9PN9WG83X4XF","Title":{"en":"Aragami 2"},"Description":{"en":"Aragami 2 is a third person stealth game where you play as an assassin with the power to control the shadows.

You’re not a hero. Thrust into unfortunate circumstances, you find yourself with no other option than to unravel what might be your biggest case yet. \r\n\r\nThere is no choice. We change, but we change nothing. Get to work, detective.  \r\n\r\nABOUT \r\n\r\nBackbone is a post-noir narrative adventure. Become raccoon private eye Howard Lotor and explore dystopian Vancouver inhabited by animals as you uncover a deeply personal story of change and transformation. \r\n\r\nBackbone is inspired by film noir, weird sci-fi, post-soviet aesthetics, modern political regimes, the works of Lynch and Kaufman, and existential philosophy of Sartre. It is a linear, cinematic narrative experience that subverts genre and challenges your perception of what it means to be a person. \r\n\r\nGAMEPLAY \r\n\r\nBackbone’s gameplay is focused on storytelling and emotional expression, featuring rich and elaborate dialogues inspired by old school CRPGs, as well as exploration of the lush environments. The end of all things is inevitable, but defining which version of Howard Lotor reaches the conclusion is up to you. \r\n\r\nAs Howard, you will: \r\n\r\n• Make meaningful connections with a diverse cast of characters in pursuit of truth \r\n• Shape and express your identity through dialogue choices - decide what kind of person you want to be \r\n• Explore and experience both downtrodden and flourishing districts of a strange, yet familiar version of Vancouver \r\n• Come to terms with the universal pain of existence and loss \r\n• Be a raccoon \r\n \r\nFEATURES \r\n\r\nPost-noir dystopia \r\n\r\nBackbone’s Vancouver is a dangerous place, bleak and dreary, but not entirely without hope. It’s a tale of a cold and uncaring world, interspersed with genuine connections and a bruised but undying drive to make a difference. Everyone wants to change the world, but not always for the better. \r\n\r\nStunning visuals \r\n\r\nThe breathtaking combination of high-resolution pixel art and 3D effects like dynamic lighting, pouring rain, volumetric fog and neon lights bring the sprawling City to life. Visit iconic Vancouver locations like Gastown, Granville and Fairmont Hotel, reimagined in a world now inhabited by anthropomorphic animals. \r\n\r\nEvocative and unforgettable soundtrack \r\n\r\nOriginal doom jazz soundtrack by Danshin and Arooj Aftab features an innovative combination of classic jazz and electronic music. Backbone’s OST is expertly crafted to create a cinematic, atmospheric, and simply jaw-dropping soundscape that serves and enhances storytelling.

Enter a labyrinth that moves as you move, where mastering the elements is key to defeating enemies and uncovering the mysteries of this underground world. With a new experience awaiting every time you enter the dungeon, let the power bestowed by the crown guide you in this challenging adventure!\r\n\r\nProcedurally Generated Maze\r\n\r\nThe procedurally-generated maze ensures you have a different experience every time you enter the dungeon. But unlike traditional open maps, Crown Trick locks you inside a small dungeon room to do battle with monsters. Without access to the entire map, you have no choice but to strategically decide how you will mount an attack on the enemy.\r\n\r\nSynchronous Turn-Based Strategy\r\n\r\nThe game moves as you move, and your enemies will stand still until you decide what’s the best way to attack. Take however long you need to map out your route, decide the best way to avoid traps, or how to use the elements to your advantage. A carefully thought out strategy is the key to escaping this dungeon alive.\r\n\r\nUse the Environment\r\n\r\nAs you go deeper into the dungeon you will come across terrains mirroring a variety of elements that can be combined with your skills to deal heavy damage to the enemy. Throw fire on top of oil to burn monsters and mix lightning with water to electrocute your foes. There are a lot of lethal combinations to explore and use to slay monsters you encounter.\r\n\r\nLearn Skills from your Enemy\r\n\r\nThroughout your quest, you will encounter elite monsters, equipped with elite skills, known as Familiars. By defeating them you will gain access to their abilities, increasing your arsenal of skills you can unleash as you continue on to the next levels.\r\n\r\nGame Features:\r\n\r\n- A totally new approach to strategy roguelike gameplay\r\n- Synchronous turn-based combat, where each move is full of possibilities and each battle is a challenge\r\n- Explore the atmospheric dungeons of different settings and try your best to survive until the end\r\n- Experience randomly generated dungeons, weapons, relics, items, and challenges each time you start your journey\r\n- Build your own unique combat style and choose from the variety of 40+ active skills, 60+ passive abilities, 30+ usable items, 170+ special relics\r\n- Slay 100+ different monsters wielding nine unique types of weapons or up to 120+ individual weapons in total\r\n- Dare to challenge more than 10+ powerful bosses\r\n- Solve 60+ mysterious challenges and puzzles\r\n- Reveal all the secrets and find the truth hidden behind the Nightmare Realm"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"crown-trick","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50461.13647911596394486.d3982cea-7cad-416c-bd96-c919d4e1778f.cb3bbdc1-4cad-4cb2-9128-5fd0cc39419e","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":false,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56967.13647911596394486.d3982cea-7cad-416c-bd96-c919d4e1778f.a09d31aa-8997-477b-b886-89a78d111906","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21782.13647911596394486.d3982cea-7cad-416c-bd96-c919d4e1778f.d6d76417-c941-4ea6-867f-c8d4437a6bd8","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31559.13647911596394486.d3982cea-7cad-416c-bd96-c919d4e1778f.9a6e3b2e-6642-48a9-b91a-0d27cd9c33d1","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.618.13647911596394486.d3982cea-7cad-416c-bd96-c919d4e1778f.4fd6de12-238a-41e5-8473-328583464d18","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45123.13647911596394486.d3982cea-7cad-416c-bd96-c919d4e1778f.b783d450-ff59-4343-a85a-cbabcc5db697","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29661.13647911596394486.d3982cea-7cad-416c-bd96-c919d4e1778f.0e0c0401-27f2-4d71-b5fc-e7ba870327d0","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58916.13647911596394486.d3982cea-7cad-416c-bd96-c919d4e1778f.79f74d2e-3ce1-4b98-a6fa-b74112f67ec6","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2337.13647911596394486.d3982cea-7cad-416c-bd96-c919d4e1778f.c6069c14-1e8d-412b-a9cb-f1ec09a56eec","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6967.13647911596394486.d3982cea-7cad-416c-bd96-c919d4e1778f.6fdba630-4ea8-4091-91d4-9f8daa55fdb7"],"ReleaseDate":5249351714427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":3010863104}},{"Categories":["Shooter"],"MetacriticUrls":{"Xbox360":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/crysis/"},"MetaScore":{"Xbox360":81},"ID":"BNN7BPDZ6GQB","Title":{"en-us":"Crysis"},"Description":{"en-us":"What begins as a simple rescue mission becomes the battleground of a new war as alien invaders swarm over a North Korean island chain.

Tough but fair combat, responsive controls, challenging foes, permadeath and of course, the emergency panic roll to get you out of trouble, make for a demanding, visceral and cathartic action game. \r\n\r\nExperience a Roguevania, mixing an interconnected world, branching paths and unlockable skills with the constant adrenaline-pumping threat of permadeath.  No checkpoints. You either vanquish the final boss in one go, or you try again. However, you keep some of your progress for successive runs; new paths you’ve unlocked, access to new levels, mutations, abilities and weapons.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of weapons, Dead Cells features a plethora of ways to slay your enemies. A large variety of swords, bows and of course spells, but also whips, grenades and turrets, each one with its own unique twist. Plus, mutations and scrolls allow you to build and customize your character differently with each and every run.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day though, it’s YOUR skills as a player that matter most! Roguelites are about constantly sharpening your skills, until what was an insurmountable obstacle becomes a walk in the park. Patience, you’ll get better!… eventually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\nRogueVania: The progressive exploration of an interconnected world, with the replayability of a rogue-lite and the adrenaline pumping threat of permadeath.\r\n\r\n2D Souls-lite Action: Tough but fair combat, the iconic dodge roll, more than 90 weapons and spells with unique gameplay… The unforgiving action wed to the absence of any kind of safety net makes for an adrenalin pumping ride each and every run. \r\n\r\nNonlinear progression: Sewers, Ossuary or Ramparts? Once unlocked, special permanent abilities allow you to access new paths to reach your objective. Opt for the path that suits your current build, your play style, or just your mood.\r\n\r\nExploration: Secret rooms, hidden passages, charming landscapes.

Hack’n’slash through hordes of enemies in procedurally generated dungeons, caves and lands and lead the family of Bergsons, with all their flaws and virtues, against the forthcoming Corruption.\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n\r\nGAMEPLAY\r\nGameplay-wise it's a unique mix of action-adventure RPG, rogue-lite and hack and slash game. By leveling up, you develop not only individual characters but also the entire family. There is no permadeath and you can change family members between the dungeon runs. \r\n\r\nLOCAL CO-OP\r\nPlay as two Bergsons together against the Corruption! Additional controller required. (Online co-op to be added in the future)\r\n\r\nSTORY\r\nThe story takes place in a distant land but copes with themes and emotions common to all of us: love and hope, longing and uncertainty, ultimately loss... and sacrifice we are willing to make to save the ones we care the most for. Ultimately, it's about a family of heroes standing against the encroaching darkness.\r\n\r\nDUNGEON CRAWLING\r\nAll the dungeons in the game are procedurally generated, which means their layout is different with each adventure. There can be from two to four levels of each dungeon, with a unique boss fight at the end. You can always get back to the previous dungeons to get extra XP or finish all the side quests.\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS & SKILLS\r\nRanged attacks, magic spells, blocks, stuns, healing, evasions and passive skills - it's all there for you to discover, unlock and upgrade. You can choose from seven different family members, each one having unique skill sets. The father, John - a protective warrior with a sword and shield. The elder daughter Linda - a precise archer. Kevin, a quiet fighter equipped with deadly daggers. Lucy - a lively and bold fire mage. Mark - a mindful martial arts fighter. Joey - who smashes his enemies with a sledgehammer. And the latest addition to the family - Apan, a mighty healer and a firm defender in one.\r\n\r\nART STYLE\r\nA combination of hand painted pixel art and frame-by-frame animations partnered with modern lighting techniques come to life to create the beautifully dangerous world of Children of Morta!\r\n\r\nFAMILY TRIALS\r\nA mode separate from the Main Story campaign, offering new systems, items, objectives, character builds, and more - all set in a series of completely randomized dungeons.\r\n"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"children-of-morta","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31185.14624995180811495.ed8baa2c-5b60-4b87-b24d-f01c862ad94c.f7523191-7163-419b-b7cd-9f70c3b86c16","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":false,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24025.14624995180811495.06017401-9ca0-48fd-9938-c5eb1cc1647c.9c2755dd-3aeb-4e46-8d84-7b7cbe16cea4","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.65325.14624995180811495.06017401-9ca0-48fd-9938-c5eb1cc1647c.6cf7a843-e7fc-4a95-a49b-54e2050e0594","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41377.14624995180811495.06017401-9ca0-48fd-9938-c5eb1cc1647c.249f0c37-4923-4b53-b2b6-626a401b5c0a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8544.14624995180811495.06017401-9ca0-48fd-9938-c5eb1cc1647c.75958bca-1410-4f29-b20d-836d25a6e7e1","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62256.14624995180811495.06017401-9ca0-48fd-9938-c5eb1cc1647c.2524b496-8424-412a-b508-040b31e2eb50","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21496.14624995180811495.06017401-9ca0-48fd-9938-c5eb1cc1647c.a6839939-f834-4f5b-8f3f-7446357ca931","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48472.14624995180811495.06017401-9ca0-48fd-9938-c5eb1cc1647c.4650bffc-3161-4849-bb5b-729b987a817f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17533.14624995180811495.06017401-9ca0-48fd-9938-c5eb1cc1647c.e7888d3e-7811-4881-a059-cb0b9f6003c8","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2355.14624995180811495.ae38a125-b628-4368-b2b7-7aee6730da52.4393f49e-fe03-49d4-90fc-84ae97236e13","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5865.14624995180811495.ae38a125-b628-4368-b2b7-7aee6730da52.94940d85-9591-4aa8-8e73-c0cffc89b3db","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16273.14624995180811495.cbe83c15-2454-4b23-bc7c-73a4b2726a43.24ba7e1f-63b9-4836-a24f-bc736a8e20d1","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34384.14624995180811495.cbe83c15-2454-4b23-bc7c-73a4b2726a43.89e1bdf8-e65e-4c97-890b-f080d3d58b50","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62317.14624995180811495.cbe83c15-2454-4b23-bc7c-73a4b2726a43.60a889e3-b820-48cd-b9e9-107bb778ec76","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60788.14624995180811495.cbe83c15-2454-4b23-bc7c-73a4b2726a43.769e7e7c-d848-4fd7-a48a-7f6f9a0988c1","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28405.14624995180811495.cbe83c15-2454-4b23-bc7c-73a4b2726a43.4e14cbfa-c707-428f-8b99-7ed2eaf1fe4f"],"ReleaseDate":5248753466427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":1876200403}},{"Categories":["Simulation"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/cities-skylines---xbox-one-edition/"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":81},"ID":"C4GH8N6ZXG5L","Title":{"en-us":"Cities: Skylines - Xbox One Edition"},"Description":{"en-us":"Cities: Skylines – Xbox One Edition puts you in charge of a growing city – from the ground-breaking of its first streets to the ever-changing needs of thousands of citizens. Design, build, and manage the city of your dreams, from public services to civic policies, and challenge yourself to grow from a simple town to a bustling metropolitan hub.\r\nCities: Skylines is an award-winning, best-selling management game, now available for the Xbox One with all of its robust city-simulation gameplay and unique charm along for the ride. The Xbox One Edition includes the base game and the popular After Dark expansion, allowing players to plan and design for their cities’ nightlife and tourist attractions.\r\n\r\nMain Features:\r\nBuild the city of your dreams: Plan road networks, bus lines and parks. Bring on a smog-filled industrial revolution or create a quiet beach town ideal for tourists powered by renewable energy. Bring education, healthcare and safety to your citizens. Build it your way!\r\n\r\nMulti-tiered and challenging simulation: Playing as the mayor of your city, you’ll be faced with balancing essential requirements such as education, water electricity, police, firefighting, healthcare and much more, along with your city’s economy. Citizens within your city react fluidly, keeping you on your toes with ever-evolving demands.\r\n\r\nExtensive local traffic simulation: Managing traffic and the needs of your citizens to work and play will require the use of several interactive transport systems – use careful road planning alongside buses, trains, subways, and much more.\r\n\r\nDistricts and policies: Be more than just another city hall official!

Over the course of the game you join them as they swim, fly, roll and chomp their way to the open ocean from the far-flung corners of Barnardshire (the smallest county in England) in their bid for freedom and to re-unite once again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINTASTIC FRIENDS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeet our heroes! Goldfish - cheerful, brave, and adventurous, a natural born swimmer!  Pufferfish – a little slow but kind-hearted who can also puff up into a ball and roll across land. Piranha - wild, chaotic, loud, unpredictable, and loves to bite - obviously. Flying Fish – a little aloof at times but a real softy at heart, with the ability to glide through the air! These plucky heroes will leave no bowl unturned, putting their heart and shoal into the mission to re-unite!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO NEED TO BE A BRAIN STURGEON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSwim, roll, glide, chomp, flip flop, inflate, fly and bite your way through enthralling challenges. A simple, intuitive control scheme leaves no excuses should your fish perish leaving you feeling very gill-ty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHINK OUTSIDE THE BOWL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith its idyllic coastline and quaint villages Barnardshire might seem like a perfect slice of quintessential tranquility, but to our aquatic adventurers it’s alive with the very real threats presented by crossing roads, traversing rooftops, dodging deep fat fryers, avoiding wildlife including the cantankerous locals, not to mention fragile fishbowls and the very real problem that fish can’t breathe out of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEAVE NO FISH BEHIND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe won’t dwell on grizzly fish death, but should your fish fall too far in whatever make-shift fishbowl it finds itself in, run out of air or generally flounder you will be popped back to the most recent checkpoint to refine your approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWIM TO FREEDOM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur four fin-tastic friends will be hitching rides in all manner of ad hoc water carriers including jars, mop buckets on wheels and the occasional pint glass. Cheers! Navigating in each make-shift aquatic vehicle poses its own unique challenge, but don’t worry, the relative freedom of open water is never too far away with inviting fountains, swimming pools and err, sewers full of hazardous materials to splash around in, before reaching the final goal – the shimmering, open ocean. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBE CAREFUL YOU DON’T FLOUNDER\r\n\r\nWhilst I Am Fish may look like a piece of hake to play, actshoally the controls are deliberately designed to be challenging and with an additional layer of added Bossa Style controls, it won’t be like shooting fish in a barrel. Even if you are a dab-handed player, you might find yourself in deep waters - we dare you to dive in!\r\n"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"i-am-fish","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11702.13890660958509322.81a390b1-5ffb-4e5e-9b51-d8f3f2f45a2a.30dc93a1-8fa9-4431-93f0-d14cbb15685f","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2809.13890660958509322.be708488-58e5-41c3-ab7b-17dbc4113cd7.67ea02c7-f149-4428-974f-73aae3e5bd4a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34531.13890660958509322.be708488-58e5-41c3-ab7b-17dbc4113cd7.1a5e671b-7d7d-475b-98b3-50fa856f35ef","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46250.13890660958509322.be708488-58e5-41c3-ab7b-17dbc4113cd7.c3ab792d-eb87-4981-8fdf-7d17cac28d9e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5880.13890660958509322.be708488-58e5-41c3-ab7b-17dbc4113cd7.1e3075fb-020f-44cf-877d-2dab822a440e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50160.13890660958509322.be708488-58e5-41c3-ab7b-17dbc4113cd7.475a1106-656b-40b9-aefc-976ddd7cb049","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1423.13890660958509322.81a390b1-5ffb-4e5e-9b51-d8f3f2f45a2a.77d6d5d4-1ecd-4785-aa4f-a7ad390efd59","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20522.13890660958509322.81a390b1-5ffb-4e5e-9b51-d8f3f2f45a2a.21463e16-ee5d-4bfc-af2e-1609a26f638b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45534.13890660958509322.81a390b1-5ffb-4e5e-9b51-d8f3f2f45a2a.8552d347-79fa-443a-8722-03bb41a839ed","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46222.13890660958509322.81a390b1-5ffb-4e5e-9b51-d8f3f2f45a2a.3ab39679-22cc-4d92-9698-3b945c3da1d6","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50727.13890660958509322.81a390b1-5ffb-4e5e-9b51-d8f3f2f45a2a.7bb064bc-7ee4-43cb-ac01-305f38459215","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46147.13890660958509322.81a390b1-5ffb-4e5e-9b51-d8f3f2f45a2a.154077db-e438-4bba-9fa1-742e3572e90e"],"ReleaseDate":5249359490427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":11745402880}},{"Categories":["Strategy"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/immortal-realms-vampire-wars/"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":67},"ID":"9P4Q17HQ2WKW","Title":{"en-us":"Immortal Realms: Vampire Wars"},"Description":{"en-us":"For as long as historians can remember, the ancient Dracul bloodline has ruled over the mysterious lands of Warmont – Realm of the Bloodthrone. Inside the secluded borders of this land, an unholy court of vampires feast on the blood of their human subjects. And, as long as they give it willingly, a vicious peace between mortal and immortal is kept alive under the watchful eye of the vampiric rulers - Vlad and Cecilia Dracul, forever bound by eternal love.\r\n\r\nTo the east, a cold wind blows over the desolate planes of Mourterra – The Land of the Dead. No humans live on this barren and cursed soil, and yet the land is far from deserted. Horrifying remnants of the ancient and corrupt Nosfernus bloodline stalk here in silence, patiently waiting for their chance to once again plague the lands of the living. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in Esain - The Frozen North, another bloodline of vampires resides in solitude and isolation from the world. For the mystical clan of the Moroia, magic is blood, and blood is magic... and it runs thick in their cold, blue veins. No being – living or dead – dares interrupt their dark rituals and bloody soirées.\r\n\r\nTonight, the smell of blood is strong on the wind, and a red moon lights up the dark sky.

As a licensed Kill It With Fire exterminator, it’s time to fight back! Assemble your arsenal of increasingly excessive weapons, track spiders across suburbia, and burn everything in your path!\r\n\r\nTo defeat spiders you must exploit their one weakness: FIRE. Or bullets. Or explosions, throwing stars, gettin’ smushed by stuff...pretty much anything, really. But that doesn’t mean it’ll be easy - first you’ve gotta find the spiders. Use state-of-the-art arachnid tracking technology to pinpoint your quarry’s location among hundreds of potential hiding spots - then, torch everything and smash the spider with a frying pan after it runs out.

Having accepted a request from The Morning Bell newspaper to “uncover the mystery of a small English town”, Naomi finds herself far from her home in New York, in Rainy Woods. Upon beginning her investigation, Naomi – camera in hand – soon discovers an inexplicable phenomenon in which the townspeople transform into cats and dogs as night falls... Then, as just she’s looking into that particular mystery, a murder occurs... Join her as she attempts to reveal the truth about Rainy Woods.\r\n\r\n■Solve mysteries as a human, a cat, or a dog!\r\n\r\nNaomi herself eventually becomes able to transform into a cat or dog. Turn into a cat, and gain the ability to jump and climb all over town to explore; or transform into a dog, and use your acute sense of smell to track the town’s residents. Use your respective abilities as a human, cat, and dog wisely to more easily solve the various mysteries and incidents you’ll face.\r\n\r\n■Take photos to earn money\r\n\r\nAs a journalist, Naomi is able to earn money by taking photos of Rainy Woods at the request of The Morning Bell and the town’s residents. Also, if she can manage to snap photos of whatever happens to be trending on social media site “Flamingo” and increase her number of followers, she just might be able to earn enough money to make life in this small town that much easier.\r\n\r\n■Enjoy life in your new town\r\n\r\nIn Rainy Woods, as long as you’ve got the money, a free and easy life is yours to be enjoyed. Growing vegetables in your garden, brushing up on your culinary skills, exploring the plains, sharing a drink with your fellow townspeople at the local pub...

Create energy shields and deliver powerful spirit blasts to survive the spirit world and its otherworldly dangers.\r\n\r\nSEE WHAT’S HIDDEN\r\nDelve deep into a mature and morally ambiguous story, where nothing is what it seems and everything has another side.

This world has been invented and designed under the inspiration of Zdzisław Beksiński’s paintings, Polish dystopian surrealist internationally recognized for his distinctive and strikingly ominous style.\r\n\r\nMUSIC BY YAMAOKA & REIKOWSKI\r\nImmerse yourself in the disturbing and oppressive atmosphere of the game thanks to the original ‘dual’ soundtrack co-created by Akira Yamaoka and Arkadiusz Reikowski. Yamaoka-san is a legendary Japanese composer best known for his work on the Silent Hill series; Reikowski is a Hollywood Music in Media Awards nominee who worked on such acclaimed horror games as Blair Witch, Layers of Fear, and Observer.

Nowak - you are the Riftbreaker, an elite scientist/commando inside a powerful Mecha-Suit. Enter a one-way portal to Galatea 37, a distant planet at the far reaches of the Milky Way Galaxy, with the purpose of building up a base that will allow travel back to Earth and further colonization. Ashley's Mecha-suit, which she calls \"Mr. Riggs\", can withstand the harshest environment conditions and has a full range of equipment for base construction, resource extraction, gathering specimens and of course - combat. It is capable of traveling through rifts that connect space across vast distances.\r\n\r\nCAMPAIGN\r\nTake on an epic journey across all the different biomes of Galatea 37. You will establish multiple persistent bases across the globe that will fuel your economy. Research alien substances and lifeforms, as well as fight hordes of alien creatures, clearly not happy with your interference in the natural order of the planet. The campaign spans multiple hours and offers a remarkable degree of freedom in a super detailed, procedurally generated world. You can decide on the order of your priorities and what technologies you want to use. You’re the only human there, after all.\r\n\r\nSURVIVAL\r\nYour mission is to survive a set amount of time, fighting off increasingly difficult waves of enemy creatures. Each mission in the game is randomized, offering nearly endless replayability. \r\n\r\nSANDBOX\r\nIf intense fight for survival is not your thing either, then try out the Sandbox mode, where we give you control over the entire game – including resources, enemy spawns, and weather conditions.\r\n\r\nBASE BUILDING\r\nYour task is to construct a two-way rift back to Earth. It is a very complex invention and requires enormous amounts of energy. Simple solar collectors and a few tons of steel will not be enough. You will need to build up a complex chain of mines, refineries, powerplants and research facilities to complete this mission.\r\n\r\nEXPLORATION\r\nGalatea 37 is an unknown planet in the Sycorax belt of the Milky Way galaxy. Long distance surveys detected that it is inhabitable and perfect for colonization. The planet is full of rare minerals and substances that can be found in various locations around the globe. Varied biomes can surprise you with unknown fauna and flora as well as harsh weather conditions. Construct local outposts, in resource-rich locations that will transport the required resources using the rift technology.\r\n\r\nCUSTOMIZE YOUR GAMEPLAY\r\nThe Riftbreaker™’s gameplay can be customized to fit your playstyle. You can change the frequency of enemy attacks as well as their strength and numbers, resource abundance, weather events, enemy damage, and tons of other settings. There are also multiple difficulty presets to suit the needs of both hardcore strategy players as well as those that want a laid-back base-building experience."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"the-riftbreaker","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52293.14074927307991469.b436fff7-157c-4e97-b957-11e9d6f0e0eb.b97d6b98-d674-43c1-8cdf-5c786bd6fa29","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34686.14074927307991469.b436fff7-157c-4e97-b957-11e9d6f0e0eb.eb45803a-9e49-4a4e-bc0f-9009f8c31d68","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21755.14074927307991469.b436fff7-157c-4e97-b957-11e9d6f0e0eb.f6cd78fd-aac5-4991-ac72-d99cdd16ec57","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7992.14074927307991469.b436fff7-157c-4e97-b957-11e9d6f0e0eb.2e72414f-d31a-407c-93a6-20d9ef846540","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38147.14074927307991469.e537a3e2-f637-437c-a7f5-42714dafcf6b.1fe0f9d0-375a-4603-89fe-41bf8deebb6c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52865.14074927307991469.b436fff7-157c-4e97-b957-11e9d6f0e0eb.2707458f-5700-4f0e-add6-51615cd54c10","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18803.14074927307991469.e537a3e2-f637-437c-a7f5-42714dafcf6b.c3c73e04-5bd8-4044-991c-ac85a322049a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61994.14074927307991469.e537a3e2-f637-437c-a7f5-42714dafcf6b.baa3c06c-dcce-4969-9078-46fca005eee1","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31709.14074927307991469.e537a3e2-f637-437c-a7f5-42714dafcf6b.b5cd201b-775e-43b0-9831-a40eb6f86288","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44033.14074927307991469.e537a3e2-f637-437c-a7f5-42714dafcf6b.a2ec7b87-1842-4aeb-bdd3-a9fbe392cc8f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52383.14074927307991469.e537a3e2-f637-437c-a7f5-42714dafcf6b.aee0b400-c964-4c1d-b68f-a9ad03d439d4"],"ReleaseDate":5249383682427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":6138994688}},{"Categories":["Simulation","Strategy"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/the-sims-4/"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":66},"ID":"C08JXNK0VG5L","Title":{"en-us":"The Sims™ 4"},"Description":{"en-us":"New Look, Same Great Content\r\nUnleash your imagination and create a unique world of Sims that’s an expression of you!

The Microsoft Flight Simulator Standard Game of the Year Edition includes 25 highly detailed planes with unique flight models and 38 hand-crafted airports.\r\n\r\nThis enhanced edition introduces simmers to five all-new aircraft, eight new handcrafted airports, six new Discovery Flights, new tutorials, and updates to the weather system\r\n\r\nThe five new handcrafted aircraft in Microsoft Flight Simulator include:\r\n• Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet: Our first military jet and a highly requested feature from the community. The Top Gun: Maverick expansion will release with the movie next Spring, but we wanted simmers to have the opportunity to test their need for speed this holiday.\r\n• VoloCity: We partnered with well-known German company Volocopter, which is working on an eVTOL called “VoloCity”, a vision for an urban air taxi. We worked closely with the Volocopter engineering team to develop an authentic version of the prototype aircraft for the simulator. This is our first aircraft that can perform pinpoint landings and is a teaser of what you can look forward to in 2022 when we intend to launch helicopters in the sim.\r\n• Pilatus PC-6 Porter: This legendary short takeoff and landing (STOL) utility aircraft is a highly versatile plane from Switzerland and comes with several cockpits, cabins, and landing gear variations. It is the result of our close collaboration with the manufacturer and the development efforts by famed developers Hans Hartmann and Alexander Metzger resulted in a great and fun new aircraft with exception capabilities in the simulator.\r\n• CubCrafters NX Cub: Yakima-based CubCrafters recently introduced a nosewheel option for their flagship CC-19 XCub Aircraft, popularly called the NX Cub, which we are pleased to introduce to the flight sim audience to further enhance our bush flying and off airport options.\r\n• Aviat Pitts Special S1S: One of our most popular planes gets a single-seat option with the release of this aircraft.\r\n\r\nNew Airports - We are adding eight handcrafted airports in Central Europe and the United States:\r\n• Germany\r\n     o Leipzig/Halle Airport (EDDP)\r\n     o Allgäu Airport Memmingen (EDJA)\r\n     o Kassel Airport (EDVK)\r\n•Switzerland\r\n     o Lugano Airport (LSZA)\r\n     o Zurich Airport (LSZH)\r\n     o Luzern-Beromunster Airport (LSZO)\r\n•United States\r\n     o Patrick Space Force Base (KCOF)\r\n     o Marine Corps Air Station Miramar (KNKX)\r\n\r\nThe Game of the Year release is adding information about 545 previously missing airports in the United States.\r\n\r\nNew Missions -Based on the popularity of the recently introduced Discovery Flights, we are adding an additional six locations (Helsinki, Freiburg im Breisgau, Mecca, Monument Valley, Singapore, and Mount Cook) to this popular series.\r\n\r\nNew Tutorials - To further expand the onboarding experience, we are adding 14 new tutorials, introducing simmers to Bush flying (in an Icon A5) and IFR (in a Cessna 172).\r\n\r\nNew Features - We are also pleased to introduce several highly requested features by the community: an updated weather system, early access to DX12, and a dev mode replay system.\r\n\r\nNew Photogrammetry Cities - As part of our ongoing collaboration with Bing Maps, we are pleased to add a number of new photogrammetry cities: Helsinki (Finland), Freiburg im Breisgau (Germany), Brighton, Derby, Eastbourne, Newcastle, and Nottingham (UK) and Utrecht (Netherlands).\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator Standard Game of the Year Edition will be available as a free update for owners on PC and Xbox Series X|S. For new users, the GOTY Standard Edition is the perfect entry point to flight simming as it offers an even richer experience, and it will be the item they purchase as we are retiring the original. Invite your friends to experience the wonders of flight. The sky is calling!\r\n"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"microsoft-flight-simulator","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":0,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13568.13812224868484781.17992d5a-54a4-4eb9-b62c-fbb7cee6d597.2f281734-d35f-4c07-b654-fa7be94aaa7f","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53348.13763447606987253.cdd9ae82-b2b3-40ef-a711-e5f137b50b22.4cf3deab-fc90-4ce9-a171-2d64066ebc7b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10283.13763447606987253.cdd9ae82-b2b3-40ef-a711-e5f137b50b22.75a845c9-d765-483c-9a49-44196f9fdff4","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56326.13763447606987253.cdd9ae82-b2b3-40ef-a711-e5f137b50b22.244d6e85-ce04-4c30-8f58-5e8030001898","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19116.13763447606987253.cdd9ae82-b2b3-40ef-a711-e5f137b50b22.f9766df1-b74b-445e-8237-942a082c0a58","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36297.13763447606987253.cdd9ae82-b2b3-40ef-a711-e5f137b50b22.ea3e204a-c28b-4506-b14b-4bcc8e03220f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60236.13763447606987253.cdd9ae82-b2b3-40ef-a711-e5f137b50b22.01df03ea-e8ab-4fd6-a586-57099e02439a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28917.13763447606987253.cdd9ae82-b2b3-40ef-a711-e5f137b50b22.8ec955eb-23b4-4710-9ca2-98026edef0b8","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47267.13763447606987253.cdd9ae82-b2b3-40ef-a711-e5f137b50b22.f9f81b2f-4764-45a0-82d0-ae1d2ba25cec","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55048.13763447606987253.cdd9ae82-b2b3-40ef-a711-e5f137b50b22.9fa14373-51c1-43e0-a3c7-bc52d2af6fc9","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61666.13763447606987253.cdd9ae82-b2b3-40ef-a711-e5f137b50b22.07ccb131-633f-4c00-9f66-d3919548a944","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43633.13812224868484781.17992d5a-54a4-4eb9-b62c-fbb7cee6d597.8fbc5b07-ba70-4bea-aa15-133b0dcc9d71","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32859.13812224868484781.17992d5a-54a4-4eb9-b62c-fbb7cee6d597.d980c1fd-d98d-4d4b-b66a-deb29b82b67b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7594.13812224868484781.17992d5a-54a4-4eb9-b62c-fbb7cee6d597.6d597193-bfb4-4023-bcbf-9371479327ca","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33250.13812224868484781.17992d5a-54a4-4eb9-b62c-fbb7cee6d597.9ef410eb-a7e2-4190-b6ed-d8bfadf1c3e8"],"ReleaseDate":5249414498427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":1251749888}},{"Categories":["Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/middle-earth-shadow-of-war/"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":81},"ID":"9PDV8FKWP3B4","Title":{"en":"Middle-earth™: Shadow of War™"},"Description":{"en":"Go behind enemy lines to forge your army, conquer Fortresses and dominate Mordor from within.

Barely.\r\n\r\nTake on the role of a powerful leader and mystic. Empowered with the gifts of technopathy, the ability to sense and affect electrical currents. \r\n\r\nYou are the last hope to a band of outcastes and refugees. Lead them across the randomly generated wastelands. Pick fights with greedy slavers and crazy machines using the turn-based card combat. Can you survive long enough to reach the mysterious Crypt?\r\n\r\nNowhere Prophet is a single player card game with procedurally generated maps, a high difficulty and permadeath. At it's heart are two distinct parts of gameplay: Travel and combat.\r\n\r\nDuring travel you navigate across a procedurally generated map. Make sure your convoy has enough resources to travel as you pick your route. On your journey you will encounter strange places and even stranger people. You will be thrust into situations that put the fate of your followers in your hands. \r\n\r\nIf you're lucky enough to gain some rewards, maybe for helping someone - or robbing them, then you can invest those to improve your decks. Recruit more followers to have more and different units to put into battle. Equip your prophet or level up and learn new skills to have access to stronger action cards in combat.\r\n\r\nYou will have to overcome some enemies to keep your convoy and resources together. And sometimes you may even want to pick a fight for righteousness or just for loot. Once in battle the game changes to the turn-based card game mode. \r\n\r\nPlay convoy cards to put your followers onto the field and position them so you can overcome your enemy. Or play action cards to dramatically change the battlefield. But be careful: If you're wounded you will have to find a safe place to heal. And if one of your followers takes too many wounds, they are lost forever.\r\n\r\n\r\nNowhere Prophet is set on a far off planet called Soma. Your story begins many years after the Crash, a complete technological collapse. Civilization has broken down and the lack of resources made everyone turn either bandit or madman.\r\n\r\nIn this world inspired by Indian culture you lead a convoy of outcastes. These desperate men and woman following your vision of a better future. Under your guidance they travel with you through the wastelands. Your goal is the Crypt, a mystical place that promises untainted technology and safety. \r\n\r\nIf you can survive long enough to find it."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"nowhere-prophet","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32015.14465196299932863.0fad387d-499a-4f06-b7ee-5b9e30e54212.f8c18113-775c-4518-b5b7-3e7003617035","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":false,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48227.14465196299932863.0fad387d-499a-4f06-b7ee-5b9e30e54212.154b4b53-2c84-4b68-9d07-6e3315dd6a99","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37012.14465196299932863.0fad387d-499a-4f06-b7ee-5b9e30e54212.d6a0885b-ac39-473d-9f26-9d51a159c6a0","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29669.14465196299932863.0fad387d-499a-4f06-b7ee-5b9e30e54212.e40e6c64-a542-4101-969e-fbcd83b37253","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28098.14465196299932863.0fad387d-499a-4f06-b7ee-5b9e30e54212.6d6bf54f-3986-4671-a3fc-ffeebc700d68","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32064.14465196299932863.0fad387d-499a-4f06-b7ee-5b9e30e54212.6bbe106a-b6c0-4200-8920-46883329ec8b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11999.14465196299932863.0fad387d-499a-4f06-b7ee-5b9e30e54212.92151f50-79e9-4a67-92eb-a33cedc6371c"],"ReleaseDate":5249001794427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":857874432}},{"Categories":["Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/nuclear-throne/"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":89},"ID":"9PCCFDH6LMQJ","Title":{"en":"Nuclear Throne"},"Description":{"en":"Nuclear Throne is a post-apocalyptic roguelike-like top-down shooter.

Featuring turn-based tactical combat on procedurally generated maps, and resource management on a global scale, Phoenix Point offers endless replayability and a brutal challenge.\r\n\r\nFollowing a global environmental disaster, the Pandoravirus appeared and began reshaping creatures, including humans, into hideous mutants. Unable to stop the progress of the virus, much of human civilization was wiped out -- only small enclaves remain, separated by their principles and the vast landscape. The Phoenix Project, an ancient failsafe against global catastrophe is the only hope to unite mankind and take back the planet.\r\n\r\nLead the Phoenix Project from its base at Phoenix Point. Research and develop new technologies and techniques, plan operations, build alliances to unite the planet-- or simply destroy your rivals. It's up to you to save the planet and rebuild civilization, but there may be much more to the alien threat than meets the eye.\r\n\r\n* Mutating Alien Menace: Face down an ever-changing alien threat that adapts to your tactics and offers no respite even as your team becomes more powerful and technologically advanced.\r\n\r\n* Uncover the Secrets of the Pandoravirus: Phoenix Point features a complex narrative, with multiple endings that the player can only uncover via multiple playthroughs. Discover a secret history, as you learn about the origins of the mutants, the Pandoravirus, and Phoenix Point itself through exploration, diplomacy, and research.\r\n\r\n* Manage Diplomatic Relations: The Phoenix Project is not the only organization trying to reclaim the Earth. The militaristic New Jericho, the mystical Disciples of Anu, and the technophiles of Synedrion all offer unique rewards for co-operation and threats for opposition. It is up to you to decide how, or even if, to deal with them.\r\n\r\n* Take Aim on the Battlefield: In addition to equipping and commanding units, Phoenix Point lets you take direct control of your soldier's shots in combat, with a unique free-aiming system. Target enemy weakspots, weapons, or valuables, or just go for center mass.\r\n\r\n* Next-Gen Tech with Classic Pedigree: Phoenix Point was designed by Julian Gollop, the creator of the X-COM series in the 1990s. Keeping the core ethos of X-COM while updating the visuals, technology, and systems to modern standards has made Phoenix Point best-in-class."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"phoenix-point","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23750.14507726714197033.ea391b48-d8cb-4724-a6cb-765168bd5161.0029c50b-c234-475e-9928-0185fc83e0aa","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":false,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27297.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.8f0d79d4-fb71-4169-bb64-0b77cac69f7f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3522.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.17680a69-6b0d-4293-a53c-6d16fe0035fd","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39128.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.c1af4919-7997-458a-ae19-4b9cf83ecfaa","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63541.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.c3d3f2f0-5855-4872-bbdd-720b19605e27","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34869.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.dd0e9d28-4298-463e-98c1-032a9fa45f9c"],"ReleaseDate":5248809122427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":23249833147}},{"Categories":["Action & adventure","Family & kids","Platformer"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/phogs!/"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":81},"ID":"9P6X271HLG8Q","Title":{"en":"PHOGS!"},"Description":{"en":"In PHOGS! you play as a duo of dogs on a captivating, puzzle-filled adventure.

As you learn what happened on the island, you will find that you are playing a key role in an epic story whose ending has not yet been written. Explore deeper connections in these stunning and surreal Ages, uncover a story of ruthless family betrayal, and make choices that will affect both you, and the world of Myst itself.\r\n\r\nCyan, the indie studio that created the beloved classic, has reimagined Myst.\r\n\r\nBuilt from the ground up, Myst is teeming with new art, new sound, re-imagined interactions, and even optional puzzle randomization. Finally... the highly anticipated modern Myst experience has arrived!\r\n\r\nNEW AND REQUESTED FEATURES\r\n\r\nFor the first time in Myst’s history, enjoy the game in many different languages through localized UI, including dialogue and gameplay-context subtitles.\r\n\r\n- A variety of accessibility options to assist in gameplay.\r\n- A large number of graphics options to choose from, such as supersampling options and Ray Tracing to bring the best Myst experience out of the hardware you have.\r\n\r\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nQ: I bought Myst when it first came out in 1993. Can I get a free upgrade to this new version?\r\nA: Thank you for your support over the years! We are not giving out free upgrades to previous purchasers of the original Myst. We put a lot of effort into making this new version of Myst and would appreciate your financial support again!\r\n\r\nQ: Does this version of Myst support VR?\r\nA: This version of Myst does not support VR, as the platform itself does not support it.\r\n\r\nQ: I want to play Myst, but am concerned about my computer not meeting the minimum requirements. What should I do?\r\nA: If your machine does not meet the minimum requirements and you still want to try Myst out, we recommend enabling one of our supersampling options through the graphics settings menu to see if it alleviates performance concerns.

In this corrupt gambler’s paradise, the stakes are high and The House always wins. Play a varied and challenging world of events as Tyler; the Racer, Mac; the Showman and Jess; the Wheelman.

Craft unique rides with deeper performance and visual customization than ever before. Push them to the limit when you narrowly escape the heat in epic cop battles.

Support.xbox.com\r\n\r\nA galaxy-spanning adventure awaits in STAR WARS Jedi: Fallen Order, a new 3rd person action-adventure title from Respawn Entertainment. This narratively-driven single player game puts you in the role of a Jedi Padawan who narrowly escaped the purge of Order 66 following the events of Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith. On a quest to rebuild the Jedi Order, you must pick up the pieces of your shattered past to complete your training, develop new powerful Force abilities, and master the art of the iconic lightsaber - all while staying one step ahead of the Empire and its deadly Inquisitors. \r\n\r\nWhile mastering your abilities, players will engage in cinematically-charged lightsaber and Force combat designed to deliver the kind of intense STAR WARS lightsaber battles as seen in the films. Players will need to approach enemies strategically, sizing up strengths and weaknesses while cleverly utilizing your Jedi training to overcome your opponents and solve the mysteries that lay in your path. \r\n\r\nSTAR WARS fans will recognize iconic locations, weapons, gear, and enemies while also meeting a roster of fresh characters, locations, creatures, droids and adversaries new to STAR WARS. As part of this authentic STAR WARS story, fans will delve into a galaxy recently seized by the Empire. As a Jedi hero-turned-fugitive, players will need to fight for survival while exploring the mysteries of a long-extinct civilization all in an effort to rebuild the remnants of the Jedi Order as the Empire seeks to erase the Jedi completely.\r\n\r\nKEY FEATURES\r\n\r\n● Cinematic, Immersive Combat – Jedi: Fallen Order delivers the fantasy of becoming a Jedi through its innovative lightsaber combat system – striking, parrying, dodging - partnered with a suite of powerful Force abilities you’ll need to leverage to overcome obstacles that stand in your way. This combat system is intuitive to pick up, but takes training and practice to fully master its nuances as you gain new powers and abilities along your adventure.\r\n\r\n● A New Jedi Story Begins - As a former Padawan on the run from the Empire, you must complete your training before Imperial Inquisitors discover your plan to revive the Jedi Order. Aided by a former Jedi Knight, a cantankerous pilot, and a fearless droid, you must escape the evil machinations of the Empire in a story-driven adventure. Explore and overcome a wide range of challenges focused on combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving. \r\n\r\n● The Galaxy Awaits - Ancient forests, windswept rock faces, and haunted jungles are all unique biomes you’ll explore in Jedi: Fallen Order, with the freedom to decide when and where you go next. As you unlock new powers and abilities, opportunities open up to re-traverse maps in new ways; leveraging the Force to augment the way you explore. Move quickly, however, as the Empire is actively hunting your every step in their effort to exterminate all remnants of the Jedi Order.\r\n\r\nConditions & restrictions apply.

Players will have to earn enough money to not only purchase new aircraft, but build a mercenary army of their own in order to take on waves of increasingly difficult opposition as they struggle to take on a myriad of changing missions.\r\n\r\nKey Features:\r\n- Fly in varied and exciting scenarios and locations unlike you've ever seen before\r\n- Engaging single player campaign\r\n- Over 20 different aircraft and over 40 unique weapons at your disposal\r\n- Fight different kinds of adversaries such as giant mechanized fortresses and railgun cannons\r\n- Test your skills in Conquest mode and fight against hordes of adversaries\r\n- Want a different Conquest experience? - Adjust it with modifiers to your liking\r\n- Beautiful 3D Volumetric clouds rendered with TrueSKY"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"project-wingman","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46542.13774735967551951.4e47740d-df56-4f79-8338-58493ef3afb7.b870b249-5bf3-40e3-86e8-a731ee830abf","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":false,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9940.13774735967551951.0dcf0cbc-c24a-49ae-a954-08869b2d1c69.4efea97e-81c4-4ee2-90e8-16dd0dc385eb","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54303.13774735967551951.0dcf0cbc-c24a-49ae-a954-08869b2d1c69.566f4957-80ac-4553-9369-a9e09cb24a6f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22411.13774735967551951.0dcf0cbc-c24a-49ae-a954-08869b2d1c69.094a3050-d339-4029-89df-952c709a5d0b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28960.13774735967551951.0dcf0cbc-c24a-49ae-a954-08869b2d1c69.d4a934e1-28d8-4b14-8eab-46bb6570db0e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36962.13774735967551951.0dcf0cbc-c24a-49ae-a954-08869b2d1c69.47328180-3ae7-4cc9-91d2-3a39b71ae39b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64887.13774735967551951.0dcf0cbc-c24a-49ae-a954-08869b2d1c69.9aef9938-3012-4753-ba68-91eb15a2e519","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18984.13774735967551951.0dcf0cbc-c24a-49ae-a954-08869b2d1c69.4ceabdb2-ecfe-4a0f-a7e4-b5b6db001932","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8960.13774735967551951.0dcf0cbc-c24a-49ae-a954-08869b2d1c69.b11f42dc-6de0-4c38-8d84-35832af92d96"],"ReleaseDate":5249317154427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":5916229632}},{"Categories":["Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/project-winter/"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":75},"ID":"9P3SX4G50LZ1","Title":{"en":"Project Winter"},"Description":{"en":"Betray your friends in this 8 person multiplayer focused on social deception and survival.\r\n\r\nCommunication and teamwork is essential to the survivors’ ultimate goal of escape.

You will start with a red radio to communicate with your fellow traitor.\r\n- Use traitor crates and hatches scattered throughout the map to gain advantage against survivors. Crates hold equipment and reward you with traitor points that can be used to perform special actions. Hatches let you quickly travel to different key locations across the map.\r\n- Spend traitor points on special abilities. Points can be used to activate your roll ability, as well as to sabotage objectives, bunker consoles, and other objects across the map.\r\n- Use traps, poison and many other tools in your toolkit to hinder or kill the survivors. Prevent them from escaping before time runs out in order to win!\r\n- Blend in with the survivors. Do not reveal yourself too early… they can always defend themselves."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"project-winter","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16695.14531941798076248.24a50d59-1eb1-42ec-9536-d8999332ca19.1733c56e-95ff-4a66-a173-8df86227f6b2","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":false,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59427.14531941798076248.24a50d59-1eb1-42ec-9536-d8999332ca19.0cd8b165-7b27-4742-8eda-de1641ab8224","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47299.14531941798076248.24a50d59-1eb1-42ec-9536-d8999332ca19.60937e99-1306-4a52-a28b-1a0919c74a28","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64235.14531941798076248.24a50d59-1eb1-42ec-9536-d8999332ca19.b0ea56c6-4194-4549-848c-72e3eaf73f7e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19148.14531941798076248.24a50d59-1eb1-42ec-9536-d8999332ca19.1523ee8a-d902-4f32-b7df-76580b1f1944","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8201.14531941798076248.24a50d59-1eb1-42ec-9536-d8999332ca19.50e4d9ca-0495-4baf-a1b3-14908fc76ecb","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37830.14531941798076248.24a50d59-1eb1-42ec-9536-d8999332ca19.5e598311-1e57-43fb-b260-6949a081cdb3","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60545.14531941798076248.24a50d59-1eb1-42ec-9536-d8999332ca19.834a32a4-f20c-4b33-9316-1f4b0ecdcee9","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22276.14531941798076248.24a50d59-1eb1-42ec-9536-d8999332ca19.c9594189-a6fc-42bd-a99b-1abfb5fb6383","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40754.14531941798076248.24a50d59-1eb1-42ec-9536-d8999332ca19.fc702502-5e59-4f7c-9d60-08e4b018494d","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54723.14531941798076248.24a50d59-1eb1-42ec-9536-d8999332ca19.7df9dab3-dd6a-4fbd-9348-983d0b1876a8","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3201.14531941798076248.24a50d59-1eb1-42ec-9536-d8999332ca19.4753bb58-a3b4-48cb-a990-6b2b2b3441ef","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53423.14531941798076248.24a50d59-1eb1-42ec-9536-d8999332ca19.bc7ac664-eb2c-436e-ae4a-7124cb8606fe","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40016.14531941798076248.24a50d59-1eb1-42ec-9536-d8999332ca19.4bbae0aa-1f4d-4285-958f-9b64bce869ad","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41523.14531941798076248.24a50d59-1eb1-42ec-9536-d8999332ca19.3976889d-720a-45e3-b497-29ff02f4c606","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23392.14531941798076248.24a50d59-1eb1-42ec-9536-d8999332ca19.2bc73078-61c3-4772-8ef5-3a287957afa4","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55541.14531941798076248.24a50d59-1eb1-42ec-9536-d8999332ca19.465d39b2-16be-486c-abfa-bff4f1ab10bd","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25045.14531941798076248.24a50d59-1eb1-42ec-9536-d8999332ca19.827961b6-acbd-4579-9f8b-7df7381d83fc","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57831.14531941798076248.24a50d59-1eb1-42ec-9536-d8999332ca19.e376a857-e53e-4738-82cc-c46292c30016"],"ReleaseDate":5249165954427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":2385051648}},{"Categories":["Action & adventure","Classics","Platformer"],"MetacriticUrls":{"Xbox360":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/psychonauts/"},"MetaScore":{"Xbox360":87},"ID":"C5HHPG1TXDNG","Title":{"en-us":"Psychonauts"},"Description":{"en-us":"This classic action/adventure platformer from acclaimed developers Double Fine Productions follows the story of a young psychic named Razputin.

Seeking to avenge their defeat in the last great war from a thousand years ago, the demons have challenged the gods who humiliated them and have invaded the human realm, threatening them with extinction.\r\nThinking that their enemies had been utterly defeated in the last great war, a thousand years ago, the humans had fallen into a false sense of security, forgetting the ways of alchemy, while enjoying the peace. Unable to defend themselves, cities and fortresses fell, leaving the humans at the mercy of the demons.\r\nAmidst the chaos, as cities and fortresses fell, and as young children were abducted from their homes, a young girl named Raji is chosen by the gods to be the sole defender of the human race.\r\n\r\nA Story of Siblings\r\nExperience a story of siblings. Raji and Golu are sister and brother who have been separated by the attacking demonic hordes and now find themselves in the middle of the great war. Raji has taken it upon herself to find her brother and put an end to this reckless war. However, this can only happen if she manages to break down the might and stratagem devised by the great lord of demons, Mahabalasura.\r\n\r\nStunning Artwork\r\nInspired by Indian mythologies such as Mahabharata and Ramayana, and by the medieval architecture of Rajasthan, Raji: An Ancient Epic brings a refreshing new style to the action-adventure scene! Every corner of the game’s environment is drawn in the Pahari art style and combines hand-painted textures, rendered in 3D giving the Raji: An Ancient Epic a stunning and unique visual quality rarely seen in games.\r\n\r\nTactical Combat\r\nDiverse weapons and powers, gifted to Raji by the gods, are at your disposal.

It may or may not change over time or release as a final product. Purchase only if you are comfortable with the current state of the unfinished game. \r\n\r\nA NEW BREED OF BIG MAP MULTIPLAYER SHOOTER\r\nThe goal is simple: Reclaim earth.\r\nIn Second Extinction you take on hordes of mutated dinosaurs with up to two friends. Solo players beware: Second Extinction is designed with squads in mind. Only the strong will survive.\r\n\r\nGAME PREVIEW IS JUST THE BEGINNING\r\nThe goal of Game Preview is also simple: Work with our community to make the best game possible.\r\nWe want to hear your feedback loud and clear, and we intend for our community to be a vital part of the development process.\r\nEven so, there’s plenty to get your teeth (and claws) into from day one: 4 heroes,\r\n10 weapons (with 5 upgrade tiers each) and 6 missions - plus some special side quests - across multiple regions of our big map.\r\n\r\nJOIN THE WAR EFFORT, SHAPE THE FUTURE\r\nOur mantra is that players win battles, communities win wars. Nowhere is this more true than our War Effort feature.\r\nEach region of our big map has a unique threat level. This threat level can be lowered if enough of our players are successful in their missions and activities. But the dinosaurs aren’t resting either, and they’ll focus their efforts where you aren’t.\r\nEach week the community will see the fruits of their labors or feel the consequence of their incompetence. Let the threat level get out of control and you can expect an especially tough Emergence Event to be waiting for you.\r\n\r\nBy playing Second Extinction you’re not just picking up another co-op shooter.\r\nYou’re joining us on a journey as we shape the experience. Every piece of feedback and every mission you play matters. So what are you waiting for? The fight to reclaim earth starts here.\r\n\r\nFull details on the latest status of the game, how you can give feedback and report issues can be found at https://www.secondextinctiongame.com/"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"second-extinction-game-preview","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45464.14137276003875252.d1d6dd04-81e9-424d-a1b6-7a81e52dfeef.656ba41f-9220-4ebf-9cf4-a685da2f558d","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":false,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":false,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27508.14137276003875252.d1d6dd04-81e9-424d-a1b6-7a81e52dfeef.890b2dab-e3e1-4895-a947-c72b469d1e6f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13787.14137276003875252.d1d6dd04-81e9-424d-a1b6-7a81e52dfeef.a7a4962d-cf43-4b68-bcba-ba220fb87e3f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51207.14137276003875252.d1d6dd04-81e9-424d-a1b6-7a81e52dfeef.c9881bed-c02f-4026-822a-a5ea641cc698","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61177.14137276003875252.d1d6dd04-81e9-424d-a1b6-7a81e52dfeef.c2f3872a-8943-4e88-bb6a-c3b1b0e0e8bf","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43667.14137276003875252.d1d6dd04-81e9-424d-a1b6-7a81e52dfeef.70181623-af54-473b-a119-8f7feb4c1ff3"],"ReleaseDate":5494649090427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":10258300928}},{"Categories":["Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{},"MetaScore":{},"ID":"9P7GBPGT90L3","Title":{"en":"Secret Neighbor"},"Description":{"en":"A group of kids are trying to break into their suspicious Neighbor's basement to rescue their missing friend.

Over five alternating turns taking place in a 25” time-loop, you are called to master the unique abilities of a varied cast of deep-space operatives and outskill, outsmart, and outmanoeuvre your opponent in mind-bending, four-dimensional battles. \r\n\r\n\r\nKEY FEATURES\r\n\r\nTHINK DIFFERENTLY\r\nMatches in Lemnis Gate take place within time loops. You have 25 seconds to execute your action, be it blasting an enemy, manoeuvring your operative, or setting up your next move. After all players have taken turns, the next 25-second round begins. Now you’ll face what has happened while setting up what will happen. Each of the five rounds is your chance to alter the timeline as past, present, and future converge.\r\n\r\nA TIME-BENDING TACTICAL SHOOTER\r\nWith a varied cast of characters to choose from, how you play is up to you. Lay damaging toxic waste in your enemy’s path, slow time to land the perfect shot, or deploy protective orbs to assist your future self. Every operative possesses a distinctive loadout and special ability that proves decisive on the battlefield.\r\n\r\nTEAM UP WITH YOURSELF\r\nWelcome to the team comprised entirely of one: you. With Lemnis Gate’s innovative auto co-op feature, you command every member of your side. Auto co-op gives you total control of five deep-space operatives, effectively enabling two competitors to duke it out in bustling ten-character matches. Become a literal one-person army.\r\n\r\nCOUNTLESS POSSIBILITIES, ENDLESS OUTCOMES\r\nFrom the first second to the last, anything can happen in Lemnis Gate. Each round is a fresh chance to implement an unbeatable new strategy – or earn redemption from an earlier error. Predict hostiles’ routes, infiltrate enemy lines, and develop multi-layered gameplans by co-operating with yourself. Experiment both in and outside time, and get creative with causality.\r\n\r\nA HOST OF MODES AND MATCHTYPES\r\nCreate a match to your preference. Pick between a 1v1 and 2v2 contest, online or offline. Select your mode amongst three thrilling spins on established genre staples. There’s Retrieve XM, in which you scramble to collect exotic matter and return it to your gate; Domination, which is about competing to capture zones; and Seek & Destroy, where you attempt to wreck your opponent’s Resistors. Whether teaming up with a friend for \"hotseat\" local multiplayer, or pitting your operatives against online rivals, Lemnis Gate lets you set the board to suit your style."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"lemnis-gate","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9294.13681731712633836.33ade687-6181-4fc4-b5b9-d030dbce8422.87c45ef5-f1c0-4648-8f21-3634ac5a6d36","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19140.13681731712633836.03224608-c12b-44d8-8ea3-82ab02df214a.74c29bd0-9e19-45f6-a60f-77e491dea57e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6883.13681731712633836.03224608-c12b-44d8-8ea3-82ab02df214a.d3c84bce-1934-4c48-bb48-a90b913933c8","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34586.13681731712633836.03224608-c12b-44d8-8ea3-82ab02df214a.3ff57694-8d5b-433b-b05d-f738e117852e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35038.13681731712633836.33ade687-6181-4fc4-b5b9-d030dbce8422.03d6cebe-6335-4017-bd3f-c46fad5bab5a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16984.13681731712633836.03224608-c12b-44d8-8ea3-82ab02df214a.bb17e040-d01c-433c-bdb1-30b220188692","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7710.13681731712633836.03224608-c12b-44d8-8ea3-82ab02df214a.ed11862c-951d-42d5-9601-95996f12aae4","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45562.13681731712633836.03224608-c12b-44d8-8ea3-82ab02df214a.133f5c90-5ede-4485-bbb5-c685cd17deea","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25700.13681731712633836.03224608-c12b-44d8-8ea3-82ab02df214a.b864b994-ceba-43b4-8e79-bf4321aa66b1","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12472.13681731712633836.33ade687-6181-4fc4-b5b9-d030dbce8422.2f2ad8c5-ffef-4706-a8f7-ebf2b01809bd","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29480.13681731712633836.33ade687-6181-4fc4-b5b9-d030dbce8422.5f0f64e1-603c-43a9-a619-6d8e2c98aacb"],"ReleaseDate":5249370362427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":17072414720}},{"Categories":["Action & adventure","Fighting","Sports"],"MetacriticUrls":{},"MetaScore":{},"ID":"9NHPR05080C6","Title":{"en":"Lethal League Blaze"},"Description":{"en":"Lethal League Blaze is an intense, high speed ball game, with unique characters, outta sight sounds and none of that weak stuff.

of the Library and receive your guests.\r\n\r\nYour librarians will fight for the Library.\r\nCombat between the guests and the librarians breaks out as if it were on a stage.\r\nDefeated guests turn into books, and the Library grows onward.\r\n\r\nA good book will allow you to invite new guests with greater secrets.\r\nAmass a collection of books and explore the secrets of the City.\r\n\r\nAnd eventually, get your hands on…\r\nThe one singular, perfect book.\r\n\r\n\r\n[A Library Battle Simulation]\r\n\r\nLibrary of Ruina is a game that uses the concept of a “Library Battle Simulation”.\r\nYou will invite guests to the Library and engage in combat with them to gain 'Books' with their stories.\r\n\r\nBattles are played with the 'Librarians' and the 'Guests' using cards and dice.\r\nYou can plan against the guests’ moves by looking at the cards they will use and select the most optimal card to oppose them.\r\n\r\nWhen combat begins, how the dice from your chosen card fall will determine victory or defeat in the struggle.\r\nHowever, the outcome of the dice is not simply determined by pure luck.\r\nCertain effects and variables will shift the outcome of the dice for and against your favor.\r\n\r\nBe sure to carefully choose which cards you utilize to win the battle with your guests.\r\nBehold the outcome of your choices and how luck unfolds as your librarians and guests skirmish.\r\nYou can go through an exhilarating experience, putting it all on the line with thrills just like betting.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Conflicts that Build Emotion]\r\n\r\nConfrontation in the Library is not just about killing your enemies, it is about heightening emotions.\r\nThe emotions of the librarians and guests rise as the battle progresses, and as it grows fiercer and comes to a head, they will surge.\r\n\r\nDepending on your librarian's feelings, positive outcomes or powerful effects with penalties can occur.\r\nIn addition, as the emotional tension of the guests grows, the difficulty of combat increases, yet at the same time, rarer books can be acquired.\r\nFurthermore, dialogue can appear depending on the situation of the battle and will make one’s viewing experience of the match unfolding even more enjoyable.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Books Can Be Anything]\r\n\r\nA guest who dies in the Library will turn into a book.\r\nThese books can be a librarian's body, materials to grow the Library, or new cards for battle.\r\nYou can also use books as the parts of an invitation to bring forth another guest.\r\n\r\nInvite different guests to acquire various books, then utilize them accordingly.\r\nHow you make use of your collection to grow the Library is up to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The Story of the City and the Library]\r\n\r\nIn Library of Ruina, you will be witness to the stories of Angela, the Sephirot, and Roland following the ending of Lobotomy Corporation.\r\nYou will also watch various events occurring around the huge city in which the Library is located.\r\n\r\nAccumulate books to grow your Library and librarians, and invite more powerful guests to gain better books.\r\nFrom lowly canards to urban legends and beyond...\r\nThroughout the game, you will gradually become familiar with the story of the City.\r\n\r\nMay you find your book in this place…"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"library-of-ruina","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26406.14319598058835087.1073d4bd-a88a-4a61-9dde-a29e767387db.682f8321-2f95-41e5-8589-7ff19fab2518","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4349.14319598058835087.ae540929-fe15-4788-9dab-e68d9a4dd05e.e2ecb333-081f-4939-85c9-7d1e262e0da0","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55808.14319598058835087.ae540929-fe15-4788-9dab-e68d9a4dd05e.fbf3d968-659a-442a-a35d-f9b11ff5d8b5","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33236.14319598058835087.ae540929-fe15-4788-9dab-e68d9a4dd05e.4aa52deb-c3d9-4f0e-8148-f960f76388d7","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32006.14319598058835087.f3c1f4e3-95a6-436c-9dd8-e8cbbc9068af.2ac3eb70-9c95-4435-b060-f28c8548a0e9"],"ReleaseDate":5249328170427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":8158445568}},{"Categories":["Action

You’ll get hooked.\n\nFeel the fun: Take the challenge to unlock all skins and avatars, play against friends in local VS 2-player mode, or climb the ranks to the top of the online leaderboards.\n\nFeel the vibration: Turn on Trance Vibration and sync multiple Xbox One controllers to feel the bass across your body."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"lumines-remastered","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10399.67606811466840601.ed721e2e-e3c2-43c0-b991-0feb90662bef.76592195-9bd2-4163-be22-992a4bea8b21","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":false,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15555.67606811466840601.ed721e2e-e3c2-43c0-b991-0feb90662bef.555800fe-8c0f-4e51-aa31-cc945b7c0cd5","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8009.67606811466840601.ed721e2e-e3c2-43c0-b991-0feb90662bef.1f00b44d-3d2c-4701-9e8d-82328a228667","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30878.67606811466840601.ed721e2e-e3c2-43c0-b991-0feb90662bef.a1911931-5e96-486b-84a6-723ba0463603","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55283.67606811466840601.ed721e2e-e3c2-43c0-b991-0feb90662bef.7d84d577-91e8-49b4-ad11-0bab1cd3ec2a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19666.67606811466840601.ed721e2e-e3c2-43c0-b991-0feb90662bef.9d2d7118-8dab-4dfd-a6c7-3c96c71055a2","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26426.67606811466840601.ed721e2e-e3c2-43c0-b991-0feb90662bef.36e6bd39-16ea-4ae1-9d1d-06ca0927ca6b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40108.67606811466840601.ed721e2e-e3c2-43c0-b991-0feb90662bef.5a7f57b3-2196-41a0-951f-4a90a79288c9","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51939.67606811466840601.ed721e2e-e3c2-43c0-b991-0feb90662bef.f6bb0ccf-a6f6-4f6a-ab86-3ea3a12bc0d0","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40140.67606811466840601.ed721e2e-e3c2-43c0-b991-0feb90662bef.333c7653-006a-4269-8117-2b7d73bd95b1","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32698.67606811466840601.ed721e2e-e3c2-43c0-b991-0feb90662bef.2bef01b4-7c80-4ee0-8112-c7adeb77e667","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.65521.67606811466840601.ed721e2e-e3c2-43c0-b991-0feb90662bef.95b54673-de62-4977-9452-618a6ede37dd","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12303.67606811466840601.ed721e2e-e3c2-43c0-b991-0feb90662bef.555f23b8-ce07-421d-a8ce-82a0e44956d7","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59021.67606811466840601.ed721e2e-e3c2-43c0-b991-0feb90662bef.77334da1-2906-42f5-8b2f-3ddb3dfc7cac"],"ReleaseDate":5248341698427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":1257791488}},{"Categories":["Sports"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/madden-nfl-20/"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":79},"ID":"BZ289TV4QVCK","Title":{"en-us":"Madden NFL 20"},"Description":{"en-us":"Feel like an NFL Superstar in Madden NFL 20. \r\n \r\nIntroducing Madden NFL 20 Season 6: Madden Futures!

Save your friends. Time is ticking. \r\n\r\nAlma is an Automaton that awakens to a world in ruin after the war with the humans. Anima, the resource that gives Automatons sentience, is running out and turning Alma’s friends into mindless killing machines, the UNSIGHTED.\r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n\r\nEXPLORE YOUR WAY - The world of Arcadia is massive and ripe for exploration, with many shortcuts to discover and maps both above and below the surface of the world. When one path seems too tricky, find new uses for familiar weapons and tools.\r\n\r\nRICH AND VARIED COMBAT - Build your perfect loadout to suit your playstyle. UNSIGHTED allows players to equip weapons in various ways, from dual-wielding swords to shuriken and shotgun combinations. Alma will need to use perfectly timed combat actions to trigger faster reload speeds or a massively damaging parry to survive in the city.\r\n\r\nCRAFT AND UPGRADE - Upgrade Alma through an extensive upgrade tree via chips you’ll find throughout your journey. Chips can be crafted or discovered, and each offers different bonus effects. Experiment with nearly limitless builds from the fast and efficient to the powerful and stylish. \r\n\r\nCHOICES MATTER - Alma’s withering life force ticks away in real-time and is the driving factor in the story of UNSIGHTED. Tarry too long in one spot, and you may find that critical NPCs have already become Unsighted before you meet them.  Save or drain other Automatons of their anima for your survival. The constant passage of time can result in vastly different endings and allows for further playthroughs to stay fresh and exciting.\r\n\r\nHIGHLY REPLAYABLE + CO-OP - In addition to the main story UNSIGHTED also features additional challenge modes, BOSS RUSH and DUNGEON RAID. You can also bring a friend along your journey through Arcadia through full-featured CO-OP."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"unsighted","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19219.14551478980510727.3f872f24-72f5-4271-8bf0-7ad7e9929ecd.9791a545-0777-4e02-8be4-25361278d0b4","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":false,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46529.14551478980510727.3f872f24-72f5-4271-8bf0-7ad7e9929ecd.7dcb1414-a110-4b98-acde-8604b3ebe1c0","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.65174.14551478980510727.3f872f24-72f5-4271-8bf0-7ad7e9929ecd.8579ed81-2630-4e34-a145-e6b4b9ff9400","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64914.14551478980510727.3f872f24-72f5-4271-8bf0-7ad7e9929ecd.bde4a913-0f90-4d62-bf37-84db78de1e78","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23135.14551478980510727.3f872f24-72f5-4271-8bf0-7ad7e9929ecd.33cdafb5-63d4-478e-aab8-1d8abe3c1d9c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40056.14551478980510727.3f872f24-72f5-4271-8bf0-7ad7e9929ecd.918f326d-4a6d-42d3-8c07-b2d3032cde68"],"ReleaseDate":5249372162427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":2494083072}},{"Categories":["Platformer"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/super-luckys-tale/"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":64},"ID":"9PLMGFWCFZ9G","Title":{"en":"Super Lucky's Tale"},"Description":{"en":"Welcome to Adventure!\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Super Lucky’s Tale\" is a delightful, playground platformer for all ages that follows Lucky, the ever-optimistic, energetic, and lovable hero, on his quest to find his inner strength and help his sister rescue the Book of Ages from Jinx.

Fresh out of a three-year prison sentence, an older and weathered Kiryu comes to find out that his surrogate daughter, Haruka, has gone missing from the orphanage he looks after. The trail leads him to his old stomping grounds in Kamurocho, where he discovers that she has been struck by a car and now lies in a coma. To make matters worse, Kiryu learns that Haruka now has a son that he must look after. With baby in hand, Kiryu journeys to the seaside town of Onomichi, Hiroshima to unravel the truth about Haruka, her son, and a sinister secret that the Hiroshima yakuza are harboring.\r\n\r\nFrom the unparalleled realism of the new setting of Onomichi, a beautiful, sleepy port town in Hiroshima Prefecture, to the latest evolution of Kamurocho, the biggest red-light district in Tokyo, Yakuza 6 is the ultimate iteration the game's blend of gritty crime story, hyper-explosive combat, and all the vices and distractions those locales have to offer.\r\n\r\nEnter the “Dragon Engine” - Explore the world of Yakuza like never before. Yakuza 6 is the first current-gen Yakuza title that was developed from the ground up for the current-gen hardware, introducing the seedy Japanese underworld with detailed visuals, lifelike animations, a new physics engine, interactive storefronts, seamless transitions and more.\r\n\r\nExplore Kamurocho Reborn and the Scenic Views of Onomichi - The hypnotic lights, opportunistic inhabitants, and hedonistic distractions of Kamurocho look better than ever. Revamped minigames like karaoke, batting cages, darts, hostesses, and the SEGA arcade have been streamlined for maximum pleasure, and new additions like the RIZAP Gym, Cat Café, and Clan Creator are the purrfect distractions after a long night of bashing heads! But it’s also time to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life to play tourist in beautiful Onomichi. This tranquil coastal community is home to plenty of local activities like bar mingling, spearfishing (think action-packed rail shooter … with fish), and more!\r\n\r\nLet the Bodies Hit the Floor - Yakuza 6 Kiryu is a 100% certified badass, so that means he’s a battle-hardened veteran when it comes to the art of street fighting. Although he utilizes one fighting style this time around, you best believe Kiryu hits like a truck. Devastating combos and bone-breaking Heat Actions make a return, but now the Dragon of Dojima can fill up a meter to engage Extreme Heat Mode. When activated, Kiryu glows blue and unleashes heavy-damage combos with his fists or any “tool” that’s close at hand.\r\n\r\nFully Voiced Japanese Audio - For the first time in series history, every line and piece of dialogue is fully voiced in Japanese. Let the dramatic story and absurd humor of the series unfold like an interactive foreign film experience."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"yakuza-6-the-song-of-life","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35261.13668783294084992.4ad59615-2917-47b4-88c2-a829ef88fc9d.c9bdcfa5-d65c-4dce-92c5-b4512ee75c8c","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":false,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64155.13668783294084992.6d47090b-487b-4780-b4f2-28c8cda17771.46946a5c-902a-4f36-97bf-7f573ed108de","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28432.13668783294084992.6d47090b-487b-4780-b4f2-28c8cda17771.b61af689-b6f3-40c6-bfdf-e9a8c4c001c2","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.65357.13668783294084992.6d47090b-487b-4780-b4f2-28c8cda17771.b6827598-8d97-40bc-80ca-67b23a44725c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43455.13668783294084992.6d47090b-487b-4780-b4f2-28c8cda17771.69dea2a1-3bcb-4e20-a3e5-fb23bcb3d3b2","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51393.13668783294084992.6d47090b-487b-4780-b4f2-28c8cda17771.eb4516dd-61c4-40b8-8fce-b6bfcab68d78","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38428.13668783294084992.6d47090b-487b-4780-b4f2-28c8cda17771.f75ba94c-f692-4941-9cb6-dcc05fe49d64"],"ReleaseDate":5249208290427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":38399164416}},{"Categories":["Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/yakuza-kiwami/"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":81},"ID":"9NBJ51BD0LTH","Title":{"en":"Yakuza Kiwami"},"Description":{"en":"Yakuza, the first installment in SEGA's critically acclaimed action series, gets an extreme remake in Yakuza Kiwami.\r\n\r\nTo save his best friend, Kazuma Kiryu takes the fall for a crime he didn’t commit, and ends up with a 10-year prison sentence.

Its story is unveiled through surreal imaging and subtle environment details. Be mindful that it is a difficult game in unconventional ways.\r\n\r\nVisage is a first-person psychological horror game.\r\n\r\nExplore a mysterious ever-changing house in a slow-paced, atmospheric world that combines both uncannily comforting and horrifyingly realistic environments, and enjoy a genuinely terrifying experience.\r\n\r\nEnvironment\r\nThe game is set inside a huge house in which terrible things have happened. You’ll wander through the gloomy corridors, explore every dead room, and get lost in endless mazes, your head filling with memories of the dead families that once lived in this very home. This twisted environment, void of any life other than yours, takes you to places you couldn't even bear imagining.\r\n\r\nStoryline\r\nThis house is stained with a terrible past. Families were brutally murdered by their own family members, people went insane, many committed suicide, and other grisly events occurred. Each and every room has its story painted on an invisible canvas. As a player, you will relive parts of this dark past, and each of its fragments will leave you restless and terrified. You’ll soon wish you could join the dead's ranks in their abyss, but death won't help you leave this place. Will you run from it, or will you try to uncover the truth behind the shadows?\r\n\r\nDark entities\r\nThe families that died in the house will haunt you and leave you restless. They’ll follow your every move, watch you from every corner, play tricks with your mind, and try to attack you. Why do they haunt you? What have you done? This you have to find out on your own.\r\n\r\nGameplay\r\nIn Visage, you are defenseless; no weapons could save you from the dreadful entities stalking you from the next corner, the next door, or underneath your feet. You’ll be able to pick up key elements, interact with the environment, and search for things that may help you escape this nightmare or pull you deeper into it.\r\n\r\nDying is part of the game. You need to avoid terror at all costs, as dark entities are attracted to it. Maintaining your mind as sane as possible will keep you from joining the ranks of the dead. Doing so will not be easy, and you'll have to figure out ways, like staying in the light, to avoid going insane."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"visage","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33508.14131226080888824.022eb486-21db-4eed-bb40-6811df081911.8f60d81f-0744-47a4-b0cb-52080c9cd6f0","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":false,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33149.14131226080888824.022eb486-21db-4eed-bb40-6811df081911.3f949923-2523-4e2a-b6cb-89facef67d4e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64430.14131226080888824.022eb486-21db-4eed-bb40-6811df081911.98c520fc-f2a8-4ab0-a657-9eb059f173eb","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41171.14131226080888824.022eb486-21db-4eed-bb40-6811df081911.6bc96227-7243-4f01-aeb0-9c3d8d63bb34","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63947.14131226080888824.022eb486-21db-4eed-bb40-6811df081911.a0bf34dd-7cdd-46b7-8680-58096a205299","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6913.14131226080888824.022eb486-21db-4eed-bb40-6811df081911.ef80a977-bb11-4da3-96b3-720dd8c84889","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31989.14131226080888824.022eb486-21db-4eed-bb40-6811df081911.f6efed46-a53f-4685-ad89-b94c28c7a847","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20554.14131226080888824.022eb486-21db-4eed-bb40-6811df081911.e7e8fa8e-0798-43c3-ac28-504f400b915a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39199.14131226080888824.022eb486-21db-4eed-bb40-6811df081911.429bf5f9-6e86-451a-bfc7-0235c927af16","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33702.14131226080888824.022eb486-21db-4eed-bb40-6811df081911.cb2da354-2a3b-4328-8640-bcbf2d0ed860","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31080.14131226080888824.022eb486-21db-4eed-bb40-6811df081911.a334134a-f53c-42d8-a215-7ccadd98eb4c"],"ReleaseDate":5249082146427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":9374773248}},{"Categories":["Family & kids"],"MetacriticUrls":{"Xbox360":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/viva-pinata/"},"MetaScore":{"Xbox360":84},"ID":"BSXSL6WBJ0V7","Title":{"en-us":"Viva Piñata"},"Description":{"en-us":"Disclaimer: Piñatas can no longer be sent and received between users.(Online Interactions Not Rated by the ESRB) Download the manual for this game by locating the game on http://marketplace.xbox.com and selecting “See Game Manual\".
