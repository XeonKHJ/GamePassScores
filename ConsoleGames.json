Find relics inside Vaults to increase Breaker's ability to survive and fight on this godforsaken galaxy.\r\n\r\n# ANVIL\r\nAncient Vault Investigation Lab\r\nANVIL is an agency that searches for \"Vaults”, the remnants of alien civilizations scattered throughout the universe. Become a \"Breaker\" searching for “Vaults” and explore the unknown galaxy. Each galaxy consists of random planets and unique boss monsters. By defeating monsters and opening the Vaults, you will be able to utilize the stunning powers within.\r\n\r\n# Breakers\r\nThe Breakers are the seekers of Vaults. They have maximized their combat capabilities to survive various threats that they may encounter on different planets. Breakers with unique abilities and skills are waiting to be selected.\r\n\r\n# Artifacts and Vault Weapons\r\nOver 100 randomly generated artifacts and dozens of weapons will make every session unique and different from previous sessions. You will be able to explore a combination of different playstyles by testing synergy between various artifacts and obtain powerful weapons to get the “ultimate” Breaker!\r\n\r\n# Death and Rebirth\r\nThe Breakers enter combat with their mechanical body. They are rebuilt in ANVIL if they are destroyed during an exploration. Your Breakers will gain EXP during battle that will enhance their strength and give them new powers. The Breakers are not afraid of death because death only makes them stronger when they are rebuilt.\r\n\r\nFull details on the latest status of the game, how you can give feedback and report issues can be found at www.anvil.world."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"anvil-vault-breaker","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24835.14277836659846754.c5a47e72-eaf6-491d-a9b6-416bdb5f5d33.00495ab4-47b8-4235-adf6-2f021d94aafa","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":false,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":false,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36053.14277836659846754.0201474b-8b3a-4295-8210-e85b89f5816c.69920a36-b3a5-43b7-b41a-c945abab16b9","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56198.14277836659846754.0201474b-8b3a-4295-8210-e85b89f5816c.42c9ef71-7128-431f-bbca-81ac710c840a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20272.14277836659846754.0201474b-8b3a-4295-8210-e85b89f5816c.94ddad24-2dfa-4c77-95e4-c422598d9d48","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.823.14277836659846754.0201474b-8b3a-4295-8210-e85b89f5816c.bea1f72d-ab1a-4b78-859e-bc3b3689d240","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19514.14277836659846754.0201474b-8b3a-4295-8210-e85b89f5816c.85ac9fb4-176c-4403-8b4f-84d6d610a02c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22774.14277836659846754.0201474b-8b3a-4295-8210-e85b89f5816c.7595788e-e504-4628-a304-51dac48dec2f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.649.14277836659846754.0201474b-8b3a-4295-8210-e85b89f5816c.e8aa9cb7-ade7-408f-9b46-2834884ea4d4","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53821.14277836659846754.0201474b-8b3a-4295-8210-e85b89f5816c.5f481268-650a-42cd-a55d-fa2f3a6e27f1","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40641.14277836659846754.0201474b-8b3a-4295-8210-e85b89f5816c.ebdddba2-ab9b-4dc7-84d1-d14e315de915"],"ReleaseDate":5249418314427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":8353759232},"MetacriticPlatform":null,"AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxSeriesX":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-series-x/aragami-2/"},"MetaScore":{"XboxSeriesX":74},"ID":"9PN9WG83X4XF","Title":{"en":"Aragami 2"},"Description":{"en":"Aragami 2 is a third person stealth game where you play as an assassin with the power to control the shadows.

Astroneer is set during the 25th century Intergalactic Age of Discovery, where Astroneers explore the frontiers of outer space, risking their lives in harsh environments to unearth rare discoveries and unlock the mysteries of the universe.\r\n\r\nOn this adventure, players can work together to build custom bases above or below ground, create vehicles to explore a vast solar system, and use terrain to create anything they can imagine. A player’s creativity and ingenuity are the key to seeking out and thriving while on exciting planetary adventures! In Astroneer you can:\r\n\r\n•Reshape the ground under your feet as though it were made of clay.\r\n•Survive on and explore carefully crafted planets that can be entirely deformed and traversed.\r\n•Snap together components and objects to build bases and vehicles.\r\n•Play with friends in 4 player online drop-in/drop-out co-op.\r\n•Discover and uncover the mysteries of the solar system\r\n\r\n•••Deform & shape everything around you•••\r\nIn Astroneer, players use their deform tool to dig, collect, shape and build anything they wish. Use this ability to dig to the center of the planet, build a ramp into the sky, or make megaliths just by using terrain! \r\n\r\n•••Explore an entire solar system•••\r\nOur vast solar system includes 7 wondrous planets that players can travel between and explore every inch of, from the entire spherical surface, through treacherous layers of caves, all the way down to mysterious the core. Each of those planets has unique and challenging surface and cave biomes that offer a multitude of challenges for players on their journey.\r\n\r\n•••Customize & build on the fly••• \r\nItems that Astroneers craft and find in the world can be snapped and connected together to create unique creations for any situation. Customize and decorate your bases, vehicles, and Astroneer.\r\n\r\n•••4 Player co-op•••\r\nAstroneer is better with friends. Group up with other players and work together to create massive industrial bases or to create fun games in the extensive creative sandbox. \r\n\r\n•••Survive & harness the power of the planets•••\r\nOnce Astroneers are ready, they may choose to attempt to understand and possibly harness the power behind mysterious structures found in the world.\r\n\r\nAstroneer began as a Game Preview title and would not be here today if not for your support, feedback, and ideas throughout that process. Now that we have hit 1.0 we will keep our pledge to continue building on the foundation that is Astroneer with free, ongoing content updates.

You can shift in and out of your shadow, at any lit surface, to help Didi explore the mysteries surrounding her family. \r\n\r\nIn CONTRAST:    \t\r\n• Shift between the physical 3D world and the 2D shadow world (become your shadow!)\r\n• Experience a new story and world, exploring adult themes through a child’s eyes\r\n• Solve mind-bending puzzles\r\n• Manipulate light sources and real-world objects to create unique shadow landscapes\r\n• Immerse yourself in a lush world of cabaret singers, circus performers, and magic\r\n\r\nSome talk about CONTRAST:\r\n• IGN: Best Indie at E3 2013\r\n• “It’s as if Limbo and Bioshock Infinite had a baby while watching Pan’s Labyrinth” - Venturebeat\r\n• 10 nominations at the 2014 Canadian Videogame Awards, including Game of the Year\r\n\r\nCONTRAST is developed by Compulsion Games, an 8 person indie studio in Montreal, founded on making creative, passionate and high quality games.\r\n\r\nDev note: Hi everyone! Thanks for checking out CONTRAST.  We’re really excited about the Xbox One version.  It is the tightest version of the game we’ve made, and has had the advantage of the improvements that we’ve made since the initial launch of the game and the power of the Xbox One (believe it or not, dynamic shadows make for a pretty power hungry game).\r\n\r\nWe made this game because we wanted to make something different.  We wanted a simple, mature story – something that’s not “congratulations, here’s a fancy sword, go save the world!” – based around a mechanic that hadn’t been seen before.  If you like games that are different or unique, set in different time periods, with unusual stories or new mechanics, then this might be a good game for you.  If you like super-hard platformers, this isn’t that type of game.\r\n\r\nThe average play time is roughly 4-5 hours, but it’s like most games based around puzzles – some of you will complete it faster or take longer to explore the world.  But, we encourage you not to race through it – to us, CONTRAST is a performance, where every minute we’re trying to bring you something different.  We suggest you find and read all the collectibles, if you’d like to fully understand the story (and to get the full sweet 1000 G).  And, if you like it, feel free to come say hi on Twitter!"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"contrast","OriginalPlatforms":[2],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55887.69833471246794389.8c89db73-09ce-4d32-a517-3dd3f2acf25f.3766db6a-7aee-4557-8a5a-d814ed648d73","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60077.69833471246794389.8c89db73-09ce-4d32-a517-3dd3f2acf25f.337b34a1-707c-4ece-9e25-e5ed1ebfe835","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17334.69833471246794389.8c89db73-09ce-4d32-a517-3dd3f2acf25f.28ddfc5a-918a-47c7-8293-709300f781ce","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9270.69833471246794389.8c89db73-09ce-4d32-a517-3dd3f2acf25f.35ecb659-3df4-4fbb-a450-9a84be8bc42e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25798.69833471246794389.8c89db73-09ce-4d32-a517-3dd3f2acf25f.cc461204-089c-4b58-9a57-e03419db8e1b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51304.69833471246794389.8c89db73-09ce-4d32-a517-3dd3f2acf25f.4190ece4-e95d-4753-8798-45cf82cc529d","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45424.69833471246794389.8c89db73-09ce-4d32-a517-3dd3f2acf25f.92353e8d-3bb7-4a5d-83f3-a972a59d5298","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51340.69833471246794389.8c89db73-09ce-4d32-a517-3dd3f2acf25f.bf189b18-9977-46df-8ed7-f2bd80c1b6eb","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8336.69833471246794389.8c89db73-09ce-4d32-a517-3dd3f2acf25f.3b580e89-d3f6-436d-97d5-902b2598eb49","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47217.69833471246794389.8c89db73-09ce-4d32-a517-3dd3f2acf25f.623a64fd-8521-492e-a83e-5892653ba077","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18112.69833471246794389.8c89db73-09ce-4d32-a517-3dd3f2acf25f.22c944c4-4d23-47b3-a996-024794a25e79","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24264.69833471246794389.8c89db73-09ce-4d32-a517-3dd3f2acf25f.2739c00c-39ea-4dc7-8262-40672a70483c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16910.69833471246794389.8c89db73-09ce-4d32-a517-3dd3f2acf25f.5f9e3af0-5ba6-45a3-91d2-e280be372f72"],"ReleaseDate":5247079394427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":2088103936},"MetacriticPlatform":"xbox-360","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Simulation"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/cooking-simulator/"},"MetaScore":{"PC":64},"ID":"9N3DKKRHSJBT","Title":{"en":"Cooking Simulator"},"Description":{"en":"Play one of the best cooking games!

Enter a labyrinth that moves as you move, where mastering the elements is key to defeating enemies and uncovering the mysteries of this underground world. With a new experience awaiting every time you enter the dungeon, let the power bestowed by the crown guide you in this challenging adventure!\r\n\r\nProcedurally Generated Maze\r\n\r\nThe procedurally-generated maze ensures you have a different experience every time you enter the dungeon. But unlike traditional open maps, Crown Trick locks you inside a small dungeon room to do battle with monsters. Without access to the entire map, you have no choice but to strategically decide how you will mount an attack on the enemy.\r\n\r\nSynchronous Turn-Based Strategy\r\n\r\nThe game moves as you move, and your enemies will stand still until you decide what’s the best way to attack. Take however long you need to map out your route, decide the best way to avoid traps, or how to use the elements to your advantage. A carefully thought out strategy is the key to escaping this dungeon alive.\r\n\r\nUse the Environment\r\n\r\nAs you go deeper into the dungeon you will come across terrains mirroring a variety of elements that can be combined with your skills to deal heavy damage to the enemy. Throw fire on top of oil to burn monsters and mix lightning with water to electrocute your foes. There are a lot of lethal combinations to explore and use to slay monsters you encounter.\r\n\r\nLearn Skills from your Enemy\r\n\r\nThroughout your quest, you will encounter elite monsters, equipped with elite skills, known as Familiars. By defeating them you will gain access to their abilities, increasing your arsenal of skills you can unleash as you continue on to the next levels.\r\n\r\nGame Features:\r\n\r\n- A totally new approach to strategy roguelike gameplay\r\n- Synchronous turn-based combat, where each move is full of possibilities and each battle is a challenge\r\n- Explore the atmospheric dungeons of different settings and try your best to survive until the end\r\n- Experience randomly generated dungeons, weapons, relics, items, and challenges each time you start your journey\r\n- Build your own unique combat style and choose from the variety of 40+ active skills, 60+ passive abilities, 30+ usable items, 170+ special relics\r\n- Slay 100+ different monsters wielding nine unique types of weapons or up to 120+ individual weapons in total\r\n- Dare to challenge more than 10+ powerful bosses\r\n- Solve 60+ mysterious challenges and puzzles\r\n- Reveal all the secrets and find the truth hidden behind the Nightmare Realm"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"crown-trick","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50461.13647911596394486.d3982cea-7cad-416c-bd96-c919d4e1778f.cb3bbdc1-4cad-4cb2-9128-5fd0cc39419e","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56967.13647911596394486.d3982cea-7cad-416c-bd96-c919d4e1778f.a09d31aa-8997-477b-b886-89a78d111906","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21782.13647911596394486.d3982cea-7cad-416c-bd96-c919d4e1778f.d6d76417-c941-4ea6-867f-c8d4437a6bd8","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31559.13647911596394486.d3982cea-7cad-416c-bd96-c919d4e1778f.9a6e3b2e-6642-48a9-b91a-0d27cd9c33d1","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.618.13647911596394486.d3982cea-7cad-416c-bd96-c919d4e1778f.4fd6de12-238a-41e5-8473-328583464d18","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45123.13647911596394486.d3982cea-7cad-416c-bd96-c919d4e1778f.b783d450-ff59-4343-a85a-cbabcc5db697","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29661.13647911596394486.d3982cea-7cad-416c-bd96-c919d4e1778f.0e0c0401-27f2-4d71-b5fc-e7ba870327d0","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58916.13647911596394486.d3982cea-7cad-416c-bd96-c919d4e1778f.79f74d2e-3ce1-4b98-a6fa-b74112f67ec6","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2337.13647911596394486.d3982cea-7cad-416c-bd96-c919d4e1778f.c6069c14-1e8d-412b-a9cb-f1ec09a56eec","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6967.13647911596394486.d3982cea-7cad-416c-bd96-c919d4e1778f.6fdba630-4ea8-4091-91d4-9f8daa55fdb7"],"ReleaseDate":5249351714427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":3010863104},"MetacriticPlatform":"xbox-one","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Role playing","Simulation","Strategy"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxSeriesX":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-series-x/crusader-kings-iii/"},"MetaScore":{"XboxSeriesX":83},"ID":"9MZ8RZSD0NFQ","Title":{"en":"Crusader Kings III"},"Description":{"en":"Finally on console, you can live the life of a medieval ruler in Paradox Development Studio’s award winning strategy role-playing game, Crusader Kings III!

Tough but fair combat, responsive controls, challenging foes, permadeath and of course, the emergency panic roll to get you out of trouble, make for a demanding, visceral and cathartic action game. \r\n\r\nExperience a Roguevania, mixing an interconnected world, branching paths and unlockable skills with the constant adrenaline-pumping threat of permadeath.  No checkpoints. You either vanquish the final boss in one go, or you try again. However, you keep some of your progress for successive runs; new paths you’ve unlocked, access to new levels, mutations, abilities and weapons.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of weapons, Dead Cells features a plethora of ways to slay your enemies. A large variety of swords, bows and of course spells, but also whips, grenades and turrets, each one with its own unique twist. Plus, mutations and scrolls allow you to build and customize your character differently with each and every run.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day though, it’s YOUR skills as a player that matter most! Roguelites are about constantly sharpening your skills, until what was an insurmountable obstacle becomes a walk in the park. Patience, you’ll get better!… eventually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\nRogueVania: The progressive exploration of an interconnected world, with the replayability of a rogue-lite and the adrenaline pumping threat of permadeath.\r\n\r\n2D Souls-lite Action: Tough but fair combat, the iconic dodge roll, more than 90 weapons and spells with unique gameplay… The unforgiving action wed to the absence of any kind of safety net makes for an adrenalin pumping ride each and every run. \r\n\r\nNonlinear progression: Sewers, Ossuary or Ramparts?

In each loop you’ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you’ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted.\r\n\r\nSINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER \r\nAre you the hero or the villain? You’ll experience DEATHLOOP’s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you’ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you’re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna’s stylish sneakers and invade another player’s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign.\r\n\r\nTHE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF – PARADISE OR PRISON    \r\nArkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself. While Blackreef may be a stylish wonderland, for Colt it is his prison, a world ruled by decadence where death has no meaning, and delinquents party forever while keeping him captive.

In the multiplayer social deduction game Eville you find yourself in a village riddled by a series of murders. Some say it might have been you - or was it? Convince others you're not a murderer to stay alive!\r\n\r\nInspired by popular social-deduction party games such as Werewolves this is a new take on the concept with realtime gameplay and interaction. Take on the role of a Villager or Conspirator and do your deeds when no one is watching. Place wards to observe other players or tread through the village to visit any house and go on a killing spree. It is your task to communicate with other players and prove your innocence. Use your unique role abilities to your advantage and make sure your team survives.\r\n\r\nDevious murders are taking place in the once peaceful village of Eville. Each day the Villagers can decide on suspects and execute them until all evil-doers are found. Each night however the Conspirators gather and decide to murder another innocent Villager until they take over the village. You play as a random role and have no idea who is on your side. Use your abilities and social skills to find out!\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n\r\n• Real-time 3D gameplay: Interact with players, vendors, NPCs, use items, visit player homes and use your role-specific abilities\r\n• Player Customization: Choose a Skin, Equipment, Accessories, Paintings, Stickers, Emotes, and more\r\n• Game Settings: Set custom rules for your own play session\r\n• Scalable session size: Roles are distributed and balanced automatically based on the number of players in your game\r\n• Proximity based voice and text chat \r\n• Become a ghost, acquire unique abilities and influence the living players even after death"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"eville","OriginalPlatforms":[5],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38886.14112988465880137.944f8dc0-63f1-4f15-96aa-cab88a628053.58680fb4-9255-4789-bd26-30aa42aad129","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":false,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47514.14112988465880137.a32d3e6c-2abf-476c-99cf-5f3f774e059e.47ace6af-a19a-4157-8445-1bfef37b7613","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17642.14112988465880137.a32d3e6c-2abf-476c-99cf-5f3f774e059e.c3132942-f792-43ac-b4c3-5cb9d2762b24","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45106.14112988465880137.a32d3e6c-2abf-476c-99cf-5f3f774e059e.ef5f81d8-33b2-4a1a-8715-0cfd079239b5","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17023.14112988465880137.a32d3e6c-2abf-476c-99cf-5f3f774e059e.8af533d6-def7-4726-83f3-bfbb350e3c34","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28323.14112988465880137.a32d3e6c-2abf-476c-99cf-5f3f774e059e.1d8b20d7-efef-4f85-acf3-9e291f3e4ff8","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61304.14112988465880137.a32d3e6c-2abf-476c-99cf-5f3f774e059e.58654623-23ba-4add-a63f-e5d8a0f0f3a6","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42692.14112988465880137.a32d3e6c-2abf-476c-99cf-5f3f774e059e.ee96f73d-8346-4381-a2d9-ddb51d0022e3","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25382.14112988465880137.a32d3e6c-2abf-476c-99cf-5f3f774e059e.fd5037d1-78ef-465a-b7e1-b6da51fbd759","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14094.14112988465880137.a32d3e6c-2abf-476c-99cf-5f3f774e059e.e8d4f3f4-536c-4f99-8145-8b1c5c3bdd77","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57218.14112988465880137.a32d3e6c-2abf-476c-99cf-5f3f774e059e.6f13093d-8590-40f9-b117-9191ab552d6b"],"ReleaseDate":5249696738427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":2978701312},"MetacriticPlatform":null,"AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure","Racing & flying","Simulation"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxSeriesX":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-series-x/exo-one/"},"MetaScore":{"XboxSeriesX":77},"ID":"9NJG36MFVR1L","Title":{"en":"Exo One"},"Description":{"en":"A strange signal... an alien craft...

Together you’ll brave high seas, navigate intense storms, and plumb the perils of a briny deep. Along the way, you’ll need to keep things functioning by unlocking parts, fixing faults and searching the watery depths for precious fuel and salvage. The farther you travel, the more you’ll learn about your ship’s fascinating complexities.\r\n\r\nA MEDITATIVE EXPERIENCE\r\nFAR: Changing Tides’ moments of peril and intrigue are delivered by environmental dangers and puzzles to overcome, but these feed into the solitary, almost meditative approach to gameplay. Captaining your extraordinary ship, raise the mast, hoist and angle the sails, light the furnace and more as you learn to sail the ocean while mourning the loss of your home.\r\n\r\nSOUNDS OF THE OCEAN\r\nA dynamic soundtrack reacts to player and environmental actions, amplifying key moments in the game and heightening the atmosphere, meaning pulse pounding crescendos, serene moments of reflection and everything in between are created by, rather than scripted for, the player."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"far-changing-tides","OriginalPlatforms":[5],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9089.13955748726326945.7931fe0b-e479-493c-a5eb-ac7155d10f18.fb1961e9-40d7-4adc-ac37-19c3c48cd7c8","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47155.13955748726326945.6d3f62ef-1e02-4f16-b827-167841f7e491.f7e707d9-9783-491c-8076-6764591256d2","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7934.13955748726326945.6d3f62ef-1e02-4f16-b827-167841f7e491.6c2f7346-c141-4968-8c0a-73b8f7753e2b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31580.13955748726326945.6d3f62ef-1e02-4f16-b827-167841f7e491.9ce7154b-b767-4689-b7a5-c20197e7bfa4","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16584.13955748726326945.6d3f62ef-1e02-4f16-b827-167841f7e491.71dcbf9a-3791-48e1-9d94-1cccc78cdbab","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16951.13955748726326945.7931fe0b-e479-493c-a5eb-ac7155d10f18.fc3d0214-406b-4b9f-b0d6-8f4a584a4c1d","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41217.13955748726326945.6d3f62ef-1e02-4f16-b827-167841f7e491.9c9d1fdd-508b-4734-ad74-47f97901ce3f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31233.13955748726326945.7931fe0b-e479-493c-a5eb-ac7155d10f18.3baee96b-a68f-49fe-bd56-93789bb07230","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64568.13955748726326945.7931fe0b-e479-493c-a5eb-ac7155d10f18.22038c8b-3fce-4acc-baf5-847b29b5041a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63329.13955748726326945.6d3f62ef-1e02-4f16-b827-167841f7e491.55c84b4e-4e25-4aaa-90d9-7072c38abfbf","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43239.13955748726326945.6d3f62ef-1e02-4f16-b827-167841f7e491.580f8ea9-6bce-49b7-a9a6-2d2c4ff5ae14"],"ReleaseDate":5249503418427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":2492456960},"MetacriticPlatform":"xbox-series-x","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Simulation"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxSeriesX":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-series-x/farming-simulator-22/"},"MetaScore":{"XboxSeriesX":73},"ID":"9P6SRW1HVW9K","Title":{"en":"Farming Simulator 22"},"Description":{"en":"Take on the role of a modern farmer!

As the leader of possibly the last civilized society on Earth, you’re going to build the city your survivors live in, discover new technologies, explore frozen wastelands and most importantly, manage and rule society to prepare it for life in an unforgiving world. Whether you’re an enlightened ruler or an iron-fisted tyrant, you’ll discover choices in this world aren’t as easy as they seem, and that holding power over people has a cost as heavy as the responsibility you feel in caring for them.\r\n\r\nSHAPE YOUR SOCIETY\r\nEstablish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe. If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. \r\n\r\nShould you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Some of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless.\r\n\r\nEXPAND AND EXPLORE\r\nSurvival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills.\r\n\r\nWhile New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society’s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.\r\n"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"frostpunk-console-edition","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60016.13729671074412623.f72f7df4-e873-4e52-a4dc-651d0b3e8b0f.cc8acfbd-41d0-4e59-a807-5140924e9378","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18335.13729671074412623.f72f7df4-e873-4e52-a4dc-651d0b3e8b0f.d571ee33-c8af-452c-8e85-ac20bd5979b1","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52305.13729671074412623.f72f7df4-e873-4e52-a4dc-651d0b3e8b0f.401dccb8-1e0f-4160-97a3-504b982ab223","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13158.13729671074412623.f72f7df4-e873-4e52-a4dc-651d0b3e8b0f.fbd16426-0d2d-4c9b-9454-2d34b1824c9c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48001.13729671074412623.f72f7df4-e873-4e52-a4dc-651d0b3e8b0f.670fc54a-40c4-41ad-bb9a-19132d9501ce","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28894.13729671074412623.f72f7df4-e873-4e52-a4dc-651d0b3e8b0f.bc14d943-1c9c-4f20-b075-74091fe310c7","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60706.13729671074412623.f72f7df4-e873-4e52-a4dc-651d0b3e8b0f.ee804a31-b783-4664-ad93-79a4ecdfafa0","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56425.13729671074412623.f72f7df4-e873-4e52-a4dc-651d0b3e8b0f.b40443b8-52ea-43f6-ac30-b090993486fa","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42073.13729671074412623.aa803b1b-7693-4bf1-a3b8-519632313b08.8335f660-dda2-403e-a468-84fedcef7eaa","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52305.13729671074412623.f72f7df4-e873-4e52-a4dc-651d0b3e8b0f.401dccb8-1e0f-4160-97a3-504b982ab223"],"ReleaseDate":5248750010427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":6196576256},"MetacriticPlatform":"xbox-one","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Role playing"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxSeriesX":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-series-x/fuga-melodies-of-steel/"},"MetaScore":{"XboxSeriesX":89},"ID":"9NLX3GWW0HF1","Title":{"en":"Fuga: Melodies of Steel"},"Description":{"en":"\"We have to fight!

Traverse a vibrant island to combat invasive Rot, inspire its inhabitants, and rebuild your home. You won't have to do this alone: fruity friends await, ready to lend a hand!\r\n\r\nConcord, the youngest grape in The Grove, is now a Guardian, and it’s their job to help restore the island. That’s a lot to shoulder for a grape barely off the vine… and more than a few inhabitants are skeptical they have what it takes. Fortunately, Concord has friends like Elderberry, Rana, and Fuji on their side! With their help, you can take on the dangerous Rot and find ways to encourage other residents to assist in the efforts.\r\n\r\nThe Grove is your home, and your work will affect change for the better!

You no longer have to fantasize about being a goat, your dreams have finally come true! \r\n\r\nGameplay-wise, Goat Simulator is all about causing as much destruction as you possibly can as a goat. It has been compared to an old-school skating game, except instead of being a skater, you're a goat, and instead of doing tricks, you wreck stuff. Destroy things with style, such as doing a backflip while headbutting a bucket through a window, and you'll earn even more points! When it comes to goats, not even the sky is the limit, as you can probably just bug through it and crash the game.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer\r\nGoat Simulator is a completely stupid game and, to be honest, you should probably spend your money on something else, such as a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a real goat.\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n• You can be a goat \r\n• Get points for wrecking stuff - brag to your friends that you're the alpha goat \r\n• MILLIONS OF BUGS! We're only eliminating the crash-bugs, everything else is hilarious and we're keeping it \r\n• In-game physics that bug out all the time \r\n• Seriously look at that goat's neck \r\n• You can be a goat"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"goat-simulator","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36875.70628353720390187.c5ec2284-1a6e-4ed0-a094-b54b14b8d466.cebea296-f07d-484e-bdf5-f6840555bf02","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52810.70628353720390187.c5ec2284-1a6e-4ed0-a094-b54b14b8d466.3fd50c63-c2d2-482e-bb0d-1ebe01bbd5f9","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38783.70628353720390187.c5ec2284-1a6e-4ed0-a094-b54b14b8d466.0d392668-a6ad-4a32-9515-eed7c7a96bcb","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49933.70628353720390187.c5ec2284-1a6e-4ed0-a094-b54b14b8d466.d9ec9b0f-62eb-4794-bc2c-e879b1d55558","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59785.70628353720390187.c5ec2284-1a6e-4ed0-a094-b54b14b8d466.118f9904-f3bc-4eac-9e88-2e0357ce5e1b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17605.70628353720390187.c5ec2284-1a6e-4ed0-a094-b54b14b8d466.eb3253f2-22b8-4e18-9d8e-01cfed00ddc6","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28595.70628353720390187.c5ec2284-1a6e-4ed0-a094-b54b14b8d466.f93f4218-9baa-4f5a-a0fa-9eb449391730","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18894.70628353720390187.c5ec2284-1a6e-4ed0-a094-b54b14b8d466.7f829864-22c9-4b0b-ba69-ed55ce51656e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.647.70628353720390187.c5ec2284-1a6e-4ed0-a094-b54b14b8d466.5bd0341f-5b8e-470a-ab97-40728c0afb26","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37942.70628353720390187.c5ec2284-1a6e-4ed0-a094-b54b14b8d466.2601e3fb-bc80-4f9f-aec3-25e44d080208","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43618.70628353720390187.c5ec2284-1a6e-4ed0-a094-b54b14b8d466.a19c1d3b-e0bf-4d29-a5b4-3c0b31e78904"],"ReleaseDate":5247334274427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":3241246720},"MetacriticPlatform":"xbox-one","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure","Classics","Shooter"],"MetacriticUrls":{},"MetaScore":{},"ID":"9N6639H7VGH4","Title":{"en":"GoldenEye 007"},"Description":{"en":"James Bond returns!

Up to eight players work together to complete five rounds of increasingly difficult, dynamic objectives set against a timer to emerge victorious.\r\n\r\nARENA MULTIPLAYER\r\nHalo 5’s Arena multiplayer continues the established franchise legacy of pure, skill-based 4v4 competitive combat.

Those who are already lost may find their way to a secret highway winding through underground caves. The people who live and work along this highway are themselves a little strange at first, but soon seem familiar: the aging driver making the last delivery for a doomed antique shop; the young woman who fixes obsolete TVs surrounded by ghosts; the child and his giant eagle companion; the robot musicians; the invisible power company lurking everywhere, and the threadbare communities who struggle against its grip.\r\n\r\nKENTUCKY ROUTE ZERO: TV EDITION is a magical realist adventure game in five acts, featuring a haunting electronic score, and a suite of hymns and bluegrass standards recorded by The Bedquilt Ramblers. Rendered in a striking visual style that draws as much from theater, film, and experimental electronic art as it does from the history of videogames, this is a story of unpayable debts, abandoned futures, and the human drive to find community.\r\n\r\nOriginally published episodically over a span of years, the TV Edition collects all five acts along with the \"interludes,\" which were originally published separately, available now on Xbox One for the first time. Also for the first time, it has been painstakingly localized for French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Spanish (both European Spanish and Latin American)."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"kentucky-route-zero-tv-edition","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26811.14620558670939884.b282563f-ef8a-4a4d-8cd6-6780477a8cf6.458a2928-67d4-4818-84ec-6a54b943852d","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5248843682427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":1809358848},"MetacriticPlatform":"xbox-one","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure","Shooter","Simulation"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/kill-it-with-fire/"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":78},"ID":"9MZVSHQZ666K","Title":{"en":"Kill It With Fire"},"Description":{"en":"The spider - mankind’s most ancient and deadly nemesis.

In this third-person action-adventure game, you are Star-Lord, and thanks to your bold yet questionable leadership, you have persuaded an oddball crew of unlikely heroes to join you. Some jerk (surely not you) has set off a chain of catastrophic events, and only you can hold the unpredictable Guardians together long enough to fight off total interplanetary meltdown. Use Element Blasters, tag-team beat downs, jet boot-powered dropkicks, nothing’s off-limits. If you think it’s all going to plan, you’re in for a world of surprises, with the consequences of your actions guaranteed to keep the Guardians on their toes. In this original Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy story, you’ll cross paths with powerful new beings and unique takes on iconic characters, all caught in a struggle for the galaxy’s fate.

Charge up and hit hard with the devastating Great Sword; dispatch monsters in style using the elegant Long Sword; become a deadly maelstrom of blades with the speedy Dual Blades; charge forth with the punishing Lance; or take aim from a distance with the Bow and Bowguns.

But this force also attracts undesired interest from demons, who eventually corrupt each island — until a new alternate reality is birthed by the Council.\r\n\r\nThe system isn’t perfect, but it will be one day — on Perfect 25, the next island-to-be. But on the eve of rebirth, the Council is murdered and Paradise is killed.\r\n\r\nIn the aftermath, the “investigation freak” Lady Love Dies is summoned from exile to find the culprit.

It may or may not change over time or release as a final product. Purchase only if you are comfortable with the current state of the unfinished game.\r\n\r\nPhantom Abyss is a massive asynchronous multiplayer game that casts players into procedurally-generated temples and tasks them with retrieving the sacred relics hidden within deadly chambers. Intrepid adventurers will dodge scores of hidden traps, leap treacherous chasms, and flee relentless guardians through branching paths until one of the relics are claimed or the devices of death overwhelm them. Be warned, you only get one attempt at each temple and failure or settling for a lesser relic means you will never see that temple again...\r\n\r\nThe cleverest players will use the phantom runs of failed attempts from other players to their advantage and avoid the missteps and mistakes that led to their doom. Once the legendary relic at the bottom of each temple is found, the temple goes away forever and becomes the priceless trophy of the skilled adventurer.\r\n\r\nAsynchronous Multiplayer\r\nExplore the perilous halls and colossal rooms of each temple alongside the phantoms of fallen players that came before you. Use their successes and failures to your advantage to progress deeper than they ever could have hoped.\r\n\r\nUnlock More Treacherous Floors\r\nRecover keys from chests to unlock deeper, deadlier sections of the temple that house more coveted relics. The more difficult a relic is to obtain, the greater the reward - the final Legendary Relic of a temple allows you to claim the whole temple so that it's gone forever.\r\n\r\nBlessings from the Gods\r\nAs adventurers venture further into a temple, offerings of collected treasures can be made at altars to gain a new blessing for the rest of the run. Collect as much treasure as you can to please the gods and gain a double jump, glide jump, extended slide, damage protection, and more!\r\n\r\nUnlockable Whips\r\nUnlock new whips with success and choose from your collection before venturing into your next run.

Featuring turn-based tactical combat on procedurally generated maps, and resource management on a global scale, Phoenix Point offers endless replayability and a brutal challenge.\r\n\r\nFollowing a global environmental disaster, the Pandoravirus appeared and began reshaping creatures, including humans, into hideous mutants. Unable to stop the progress of the virus, much of human civilization was wiped out -- only small enclaves remain, separated by their principles and the vast landscape. The Phoenix Project, an ancient failsafe against global catastrophe is the only hope to unite mankind and take back the planet.\r\n\r\nLead the Phoenix Project from its base at Phoenix Point. Research and develop new technologies and techniques, plan operations, build alliances to unite the planet-- or simply destroy your rivals. It's up to you to save the planet and rebuild civilization, but there may be much more to the alien threat than meets the eye.\r\n\r\n* Mutating Alien Menace: Face down an ever-changing alien threat that adapts to your tactics and offers no respite even as your team becomes more powerful and technologically advanced.\r\n\r\n* Uncover the Secrets of the Pandoravirus: Phoenix Point features a complex narrative, with multiple endings that the player can only uncover via multiple playthroughs. Discover a secret history, as you learn about the origins of the mutants, the Pandoravirus, and Phoenix Point itself through exploration, diplomacy, and research.\r\n\r\n* Manage Diplomatic Relations: The Phoenix Project is not the only organization trying to reclaim the Earth. The militaristic New Jericho, the mystical Disciples of Anu, and the technophiles of Synedrion all offer unique rewards for co-operation and threats for opposition. It is up to you to decide how, or even if, to deal with them.\r\n\r\n* Take Aim on the Battlefield: In addition to equipping and commanding units, Phoenix Point lets you take direct control of your soldier's shots in combat, with a unique free-aiming system. Target enemy weakspots, weapons, or valuables, or just go for center mass.\r\n\r\n* Next-Gen Tech with Classic Pedigree: Phoenix Point was designed by Julian Gollop, the creator of the X-COM series in the 1990s. Keeping the core ethos of X-COM while updating the visuals, technology, and systems to modern standards has made Phoenix Point best-in-class."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"phoenix-point","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23750.14507726714197033.ea391b48-d8cb-4724-a6cb-765168bd5161.0029c50b-c234-475e-9928-0185fc83e0aa","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27297.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.8f0d79d4-fb71-4169-bb64-0b77cac69f7f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3522.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.17680a69-6b0d-4293-a53c-6d16fe0035fd","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39128.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.c1af4919-7997-458a-ae19-4b9cf83ecfaa","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63541.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.c3d3f2f0-5855-4872-bbdd-720b19605e27","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34869.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.dd0e9d28-4298-463e-98c1-032a9fa45f9c"],"ReleaseDate":5248809122427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":25358311424},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Platformer"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/pikuniku/"},"MetaScore":{"PC":74},"ID":"9N8WRDC25K6J","Title":{"en":"Pikuniku"},"Description":{"en":"Pikuniku is an absurdly wonderful puzzle-exploration game that takes place in a strange but playful world where not everything is as happy as it seems.

You can buy them from traveling merchants: it can be pricey, but successful haggling may save you some coin. Or you can just grow your own!\r\n\r\nGET CREATIVE WITH CUSTOMIZING\r\nWant to give a special appearance to your best potions? Go ahead! Change bottle shape, label type, icon, and colors.

Isolated and lost inside this dream-like world, you will explore different interconnected regions in a non-linear fashion. The unsettling environment is a character itself.\r\n\r\nEvery location contains its own theme (story), puzzles and characters that are integral in creating a cohesive world.

Each region is a maze-like structure with various rooms and paths to discover. All the storytelling happens in-game, with no cut-scenes to distract you from the grisly reality of the living, breathing world you’re in. But keep your eyes open - the game won’t show you any sympathy if you miss something important on your uneasy travels.\r\n\r\nFull body awareness\r\nPlayers will experience better immersion being aware of the character’s body and movement. Interaction with the world is realistic - objects are picked up with your hands (instead of just floating in midair), machines and instruments are operated by grabbing the controls, etc.\r\n\r\nInventory and ammo management\r\nYour loadout is defined and limited. This plays a big role in keeping the player in an even greater state of awareness throughout the whole game. Players will have to think about when to fight and when to take cover and how their actions affect the world around them.

Magic has returned to the world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Technology merges with flesh and consciousness. Elves, trolls, orks and dwarves walk among us, while ruthless corporations bleed the world dry. You are a shadowrunner - a mercenary living on the fringes of society, in the shadows of massive corporate arcologies, surviving day-by-day on skill and instinct alone. When the powerful or the desperate need a job done, you get it done... by any means necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the urban sprawl of the Seattle metroplex, the search for a mysterious killer sets you on a trail that leads from the darkest slums to the city’s most powerful megacorps. You will need to tread carefully, enlist the aid of other runners, and master powerful forces of technology and magic in order to emerge from the shadows of Seattle unscathed.\r\n\r\nThe unique cyberpunk-meets-fantasy world of Shadowrun has gained a huge cult following since its creation over 30 years ago. Return to the world of Shadowrun, with this cult-classic turn-based tactical RPG finally ported to consoles.\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\nGripping Tactical Combat: When you’re running the shadows, every turn matters. Choose your actions wisely - move to better cover, charge into melee, or lob a fireball into a crowd of enemies. With the variety of weapons and spells at your disposal, every turn is filled with meaningful choices. A successful run requires commanding a team of runners with the right balance of combat, tech, and magical abilities.\r\n\r\nSkill-Based Character Progression: Choose a starting character archetype and build from there! Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems. Shadowrun Returns’ classless skill system allows you to grow your character in any direction you choose. Want to start summoning spirits as an ork Shaman and evolve into a cybered-up weapon specialist? Do it!\r\n\r\nEngaging 2D/3D Art Style: Shadowrun Returns mixes dynamic 3D characters and lighting with a vibrant, hand-painted environment. Illustrated character portraits bring every conversation to life.

Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall.\r\n\r\nIt’s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge’s reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the “Flux State” controls the city of Berlin. It’s a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, there’s no better place to earn a quick payday.\r\n\r\nNow, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return…\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\nA Classic, Story-Driven cRPG adapted to consoles: Dragonfall hearkens back to the golden age of computer RPG’s with a novel-like branching narrative full of sharp prose and deep character development.

The members of your team are designed to play contrasting roles during missions, and each has a distinct set of skills, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses.

Fight your way across the most immersive maps yet, with many real-world locations captured in stunning detail, and an improved traversal system that lets you explore more of them than ever before.\r\nFrance, 1944 – As part of a covert US Rangers operation to weaken the Atlantikwall fortifications along the coast of Brittany, elite marksman Karl Fairburne makes contact with the French Resistance. Soon they uncover a secret Nazi project that threatens to end the war before the Allies can even invade Europe: Operation Kraken.\r\n\r\nEXPANSIVE CAMPAIGN\r\nMany real-world locations have been captured using photogrammetry to recreate a living, immersive environment, and multiple infiltration and extraction points and kill list targets provide a whole new perspective on each mission. Take on the Nazi plot solo or work with a partner, with improved co-op mechanics allowing you to share ammo and items, give orders and heal each other.\r\n\r\nADVANCED GUNPLAY PHYSICS AND TRAVERSAL\r\nUse ziplines, slide down slopes and shimmy along ledges to reach the perfect vantage point, or to sneak past a sharp-eyed lookout. Factor in rifle stock and barrel options along with gravity, wind and heart rate while you line up your sights on the target.\r\n\r\nHIGH CALIBRE CUSTOMISATION\r\nUse workbenches to customise and upgrade virtually every aspect of your weapon – change scopes, stocks, barrels, magazines and more. Rifles, secondaries and pistols all have a huge variety of options. On top of that you can select the ammo to suit your target, from armour-piercing right down to non-lethal.\r\n\r\nINVASION MODE – CAMPAIGN DROP IN PvP AND CO-OP\r\nInvade another player’s Campaign as an Axis sniper and engage in a deadly game of cat and mouse, providing a new dimension to the challenge as you stalk your prey. Alternatively, as Karl you can call for assistance and have a second sniper drop in to help you out of a tricky situation.\r\n\r\nTENSE ADVERSIAL MULTIPLAYER\r\nCustomise your character and loadout and earn XP, medals and ribbons as you take on intensely competitive 16 player battles that will really test your sharpshooting skills. If co-op’s more your style, you can team up with up to 3 other players against waves of enemies in Survival mode.\r\n\r\nENHANCED KILL CAM\r\nMore realistic and grisly than ever, the trademark X-ray kill cam returns, showing you the true destructive power of each shot. Bones deflect bullets unpredictably, ripping a new path through enemy bodies. SMGs and pistols can also trigger kill cams, including multiple shots in dramatic slow motion.\r\n"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"sniper-elite-5","OriginalPlatforms":[5],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34732.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.d7d5968f-4e09-4b2b-aea5-ea36b059cec1","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6211.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.933990f6-2efb-402c-b356-0a6256808dc6","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44790.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.d343893e-b214-4c48-a6ec-9e91c5857981","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2551.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.72068546-cd69-44e2-bd9e-06597bf3156b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40463.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.b46a49fc-a3e6-461e-bef9-19716df95233","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39524.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.1d7a605d-51ad-4988-809f-e37986e430d0","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22655.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.72fff174-717c-4b40-8672-d8c553e93ab9","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51794.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.9449b6b4-d011-462b-a8a8-cd04cf890bee","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18234.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.918d17fd-7f13-4e22-858c-51a6a3217f45","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26546.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.d30a9588-c4f9-4220-9c10-89f2dab0241c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33660.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.f7433785-db79-48fb-aa7c-980c845f240d"],"ReleaseDate":5249577218427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":107095609344},"MetacriticPlatform":"xbox-series-x","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Simulation"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/snowrunner/"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":81},"ID":"9PNRSC0J6DT8","Title":{"en":"SnowRunner"},"Description":{"en":"Get ready for the next-generation off-road experience! \r\n\r\nSnowRunner puts you in the driver’s seat of powerful vehicles as you conquer extreme open environments with the most advanced terrain simulation ever.

Roll for initiative, take attacks of opportunity, manage player location and the verticality of the battle field. Set yourself up for the finishing strike and possibly roll a natural 20 at that key moment of battle.​\r\n\r\nIn Solasta, you take control of four heroes, each with unique skills that complement one another. Every hero expresses themselves in the adventure, making each action and dialog choice a dynamic part to the story. Players will create their heroes just as they would in a pen-and-paper game by choosing their race, class, personality and rolling for their stats.​\r\n\r\nYou make the choices, dice decide your destiny.\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nKey Features:\r\n\r\nAn Epic Team Adventure\r\n- Discover the shattered world of Solasta: explore ruins and dungeons for legendary treasures, learn the truth of an age-old cataclysm - and stop it from happening again. \r\n- Create your very own party of adventurers with our Character Creation Tool in the classic tabletop RPG tradition. Breathe life into your heroes, and see their personalities reflected in their dialogue. Tailor your squad to your preferred strategy and maximize your party's abilities. The choice is yours.\r\n\r\nDiscover a Mysterious & Dynamic World\r\n- Delve into long forgotten dungeons to unearth ancient artifacts, but stay watchful of light and darkness: many dangers hide in the dark, but a light can attract monsters. Some enemies have darkvision, some may flee from your torch... Successful adventurers will learn to use it to their advantage. \r\n- Fight monsters in squad-level, turn-based, tactical combat. Solasta's dynamic environment offers some interesting tactical options. Bridges can collapse, leaving enemies stranded and vulnerable. Walls and columns can be pushed over - on top of your foes, if you do it right. The world is your playground.\r\n\r\nPrepare to Think in Three Dimensions\r\n- The dungeons in Solasta are more than flat game-boards. Climb, jump, or fly around obstacles. Evade or surprise foes from above or below. Push them into chasms or drop things on their heads. Position yourself on high grounds to start the fight with an advantage. \r\n- Size also matters. Escape through narrow passages where bigger enemies won't fit and crawl through tunnels to find secret areas. Take advantage of the environment to find cover suited to your own size. Watch out, though - the monsters are also thinking vertically.\r\n\r\nDungeon Maker\r\n- In Solasta, the adventure does not stop after the campaign is over. Unleash your creativity and craft your own dungeons to play using the in-game Dungeon Maker! From the room layout, monster composition and treasure the party will find – down to the decoration and lighting of each room or the music track playing – everything is decided by you.\r\n- Note that the Dungeon Maker is a work in progress and will keep being improved as time goes by, so look forward to more Dungeon Maker features in the future!"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"solasta-crown-of-the-magister","OriginalPlatforms":[5],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55762.13899562469464238.c1646c67-46ab-4599-8b51-491c5f064ca0.65fd3add-aefa-4bfe-aab6-067fbeb384ad","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5249263334427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":13576654848},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/soma/"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":82},"ID":"C23M2TC1ZFPJ","Title":{"en":"SOMA"},"Description":{"en":"The radio is dead, food is running out, and the machines have started to think they are people.

Support.xbox.com\r\n\r\nA galaxy-spanning adventure awaits in STAR WARS Jedi: Fallen Order, a new 3rd person action-adventure title from Respawn Entertainment. This narratively-driven single player game puts you in the role of a Jedi Padawan who narrowly escaped the purge of Order 66 following the events of Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith. On a quest to rebuild the Jedi Order, you must pick up the pieces of your shattered past to complete your training, develop new powerful Force abilities, and master the art of the iconic lightsaber - all while staying one step ahead of the Empire and its deadly Inquisitors. \r\n\r\nWhile mastering your abilities, players will engage in cinematically-charged lightsaber and Force combat designed to deliver the kind of intense STAR WARS lightsaber battles as seen in the films. Players will need to approach enemies strategically, sizing up strengths and weaknesses while cleverly utilizing your Jedi training to overcome your opponents and solve the mysteries that lay in your path. \r\n\r\nSTAR WARS fans will recognize iconic locations, weapons, gear, and enemies while also meeting a roster of fresh characters, locations, creatures, droids and adversaries new to STAR WARS. As part of this authentic STAR WARS story, fans will delve into a galaxy recently seized by the Empire. As a Jedi hero-turned-fugitive, players will need to fight for survival while exploring the mysteries of a long-extinct civilization all in an effort to rebuild the remnants of the Jedi Order as the Empire seeks to erase the Jedi completely.\r\n\r\nKEY FEATURES\r\n\r\n● Cinematic, Immersive Combat – Jedi: Fallen Order delivers the fantasy of becoming a Jedi through its innovative lightsaber combat system – striking, parrying, dodging - partnered with a suite of powerful Force abilities you’ll need to leverage to overcome obstacles that stand in your way. This combat system is intuitive to pick up, but takes training and practice to fully master its nuances as you gain new powers and abilities along your adventure.\r\n\r\n● A New Jedi Story Begins - As a former Padawan on the run from the Empire, you must complete your training before Imperial Inquisitors discover your plan to revive the Jedi Order. Aided by a former Jedi Knight, a cantankerous pilot, and a fearless droid, you must escape the evil machinations of the Empire in a story-driven adventure. Explore and overcome a wide range of challenges focused on combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving. \r\n\r\n● The Galaxy Awaits - Ancient forests, windswept rock faces, and haunted jungles are all unique biomes you’ll explore in Jedi: Fallen Order, with the freedom to decide when and where you go next. As you unlock new powers and abilities, opportunities open up to re-traverse maps in new ways; leveraging the Force to augment the way you explore. Move quickly, however, as the Empire is actively hunting your every step in their effort to exterminate all remnants of the Jedi Order.\r\n\r\nConditions & restrictions apply.

Nowak - you are the Riftbreaker, an elite scientist/commando inside a powerful Mecha-Suit. Enter a one-way portal to Galatea 37, a distant planet at the far reaches of the Milky Way Galaxy, with the purpose of building up a base that will allow travel back to Earth and further colonization. Ashley's Mecha-suit, which she calls \"Mr. Riggs\", can withstand the harshest environment conditions and has a full range of equipment for base construction, resource extraction, gathering specimens and of course - combat. It is capable of traveling through rifts that connect space across vast distances.\r\n\r\nCAMPAIGN\r\nTake on an epic journey across all the different biomes of Galatea 37. You will establish multiple persistent bases across the globe that will fuel your economy. Research alien substances and lifeforms, as well as fight hordes of alien creatures, clearly not happy with your interference in the natural order of the planet. The campaign spans multiple hours and offers a remarkable degree of freedom in a super detailed, procedurally generated world. You can decide on the order of your priorities and what technologies you want to use. You’re the only human there, after all.\r\n\r\nSURVIVAL\r\nYour mission is to survive a set amount of time, fighting off increasingly difficult waves of enemy creatures. Each mission in the game is randomized, offering nearly endless replayability. \r\n\r\nSANDBOX\r\nIf intense fight for survival is not your thing either, then try out the Sandbox mode, where we give you control over the entire game – including resources, enemy spawns, and weather conditions.\r\n\r\nBASE BUILDING\r\nYour task is to construct a two-way rift back to Earth. It is a very complex invention and requires enormous amounts of energy. Simple solar collectors and a few tons of steel will not be enough. You will need to build up a complex chain of mines, refineries, powerplants and research facilities to complete this mission.\r\n\r\nEXPLORATION\r\nGalatea 37 is an unknown planet in the Sycorax belt of the Milky Way galaxy. Long distance surveys detected that it is inhabitable and perfect for colonization. The planet is full of rare minerals and substances that can be found in various locations around the globe. Varied biomes can surprise you with unknown fauna and flora as well as harsh weather conditions.

Two Point Campus is jam-packed with new creative tools to help you build the university of your dreams. For the first time, build on the outside as you develop a blank canvas of greenery into your own delightfully educational campus environment, housing the top teaching facilities in the land. Lay down pathways with new easy-to-use tools. Plant glorious collections of outdoor flora. Place benches and tennis courts. Build a Cheeseball arena, complete with stands. The only limit is your imagination (and your in-game bank balance). Not the usual fare But, of course, it wouldn’t be a Two Point game without a twist. Rather than typical academic fare, students in Two Point County enjoy a range of wild and wonderful courses: from Knight School (hey, we all have to learn jousting at some point in our lives), to the salivatory Gastronomy, where your students will build mouth-watering concoctions like giant pizzas and enormous pies. The academic year… is here! Take advantage of the opportunity to spend way more time with the little people in your university. The academic year begins with a summer break, giving you enough time to get everything looking great before your students move in. Build libraries, hire the best staff, kit your campus out with the best courses and watch the academic potential of your students get unlocked! Shaping the students of the future. But it’s not just work hard. Oh, no. It’s play hard, too. For your university students aren’t all bookish 24/7. You’ll need to keep an eye on their happiness and make sure they’re getting enough entertainment, pastoral care and general joie de vivre to develop into incredible individuals who will do the legacy of your university proud.

People go to work, party to escape reality, complain about the government and the inequalities between the poor and the rich...\r\n\r\nAs a courier for the Tauranga Express, you get to travel around Tauranga taking pictures and documenting the world and its reality through the lenses of your camera. Throughout the game, you will unlock a variety of lenses and equipment.\r\n\r\n*This version contains both the full PC version, its DLCs, as well as some additional modes.\r\n\r\n▼ Unique and expressive grading system\r\nEach photo you take is judged on its color, content and composition. Taking a photo will net you a cash score, which will go towards your final payout. Complete Photo Bounties any way you like. Once you've completed these bounties, deliver the parcel to finish the level.\r\n\r\n▼ Exploration bonuses on each level\r\nNew equipment for your camera is unlocked by finding film canisters, recreating postcards, fulfilling timed deliveries, and finding a way to fit all of your friends in one photo.\r\n\r\n▼ Full creative control\r\nEdit your photos and develop your unique color grade. The tools in the game are flexible enough that you can touch up your photos to look better than when you took them. If you are an experienced photographer, you’ll fit right in. If this is your first time, you’ll be on your journey in no time.\r\n\r\n▼ Speed run and creative modes\r\nThe game offers replayability through two special play modes. The speed run mode tests your gaming skills and is perfect for those up for a challenge. The creative mode, on the other hand, gives you full control over the creative side to achieve that perfect snap, sure to satisfy those of you avid photographers out there.\r\n\r\n▼ What is an 'Umurangi'?\r\nUmurangi is the Te Reo word for Red Sky.\r\n"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"umurangi-generation","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42725.14260645465200380.af962a53-8815-4214-9dc3-7e92e8adec2b.a80259fd-fe98-4eb5-a7e7-1345cbcbd994","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19301.14260645465200380.af962a53-8815-4214-9dc3-7e92e8adec2b.76af30cb-a290-4554-847f-f5a7cfbf302e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49503.14260645465200380.af962a53-8815-4214-9dc3-7e92e8adec2b.8adfcff8-a261-4bb4-ac0c-3e938f8bdf18","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19216.14260645465200380.af962a53-8815-4214-9dc3-7e92e8adec2b.2df92fdb-fcd3-4a65-9f32-3b5faa0fd6e2","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29620.14260645465200380.af962a53-8815-4214-9dc3-7e92e8adec2b.47200a3e-dbb5-4c3c-9328-8021b46efaa0"],"ReleaseDate":5249569442427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":1518297088},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Role playing"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/undertale/"},"MetaScore":{"PC":92},"ID":"9PJGGX9XJXPB","Title":{"en":"Undertale"},"Description":{"en":"The PC classic UNDERTALE comes to Xbox One!

Keep your guard up at all times as the slightest mistake will be met with relentless enemy attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Expert controls and timing\r\nExecute various skill combos and counterattacks for maximum damage. Use the “Abyss” system to get a closer look at the game’s unique mechanics. Players may be tempted to turn down the difficulty settings, but mastering true combat requires practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Chained attacks\r\nEach skill combo in Unsouled have their own unique triggers. Whenever using a skill, your character flashes for a brief second. Use this opportunity to turn your initial strike into a deadly series of blows by performing one skill after another. Learning each skill’s wind-down pattern is crucial to mastering chain attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Counterattacks\r\nCombos aren’t the only tool under your belt. The counterattack mechanics stay true to the high-risk, high-reward principle, allowing you to decimate multiple targets in one seamless attack when done correctly. Mastering the chain-counterattacks is key to turning the tide on your assailants.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Interactive objects\r\nSlamming an enemy against a wall, pushing them off the ledge, cutting a tree down to crush them, or even bringing down a large object to create a makeshift bridge are but a few of many ways to overcome various obstacles and threats in the game.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Passive and Active Souls\r\nYou may come across special Souls as you fight and explore. Passive Souls take effect immediately after being obtained, enhancing abilities, unlocking new skills, or upgrading existing ones. Active Souls are manually activated through button interaction which can unlock skills normally reserved for bosses, and are used for combos as well as escaping from enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Beautiful pixel art\r\n\"Travel across five distinct locations each filled with unique retro style visuals with enemies that are spooky and fun.\r\nEach individual pixel is affected by real-time lighting, meaning, you can enjoy the rich, vibrant pixel graphics in all its glory!\"\r\n\r\nFull details on the latest status of the game, how you can give feedback and report issues can be found at https://playneowiz.com/unsouled."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"unsouled","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21108.14067847727673942.bc35e2b5-e9f7-46d2-88a7-ec8582f969a9.ca09c628-76a0-4ac6-9216-c961a33bc29c","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44056.14067847727673942.44919502-ce36-4280-a2f3-ffafbc11dda6.dc84fea3-8993-42b2-a0f0-5c8421d5d0f2","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12315.14067847727673942.44919502-ce36-4280-a2f3-ffafbc11dda6.d283bcf9-1f24-4ef9-9dab-cdd951a8fbda","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31908.14067847727673942.44919502-ce36-4280-a2f3-ffafbc11dda6.4c6b64e4-81f1-41ec-852e-b1bc8ef81327","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6008.14067847727673942.44919502-ce36-4280-a2f3-ffafbc11dda6.53bb5775-8d8b-43cc-9cbb-5ccf3c1ce7a2"],"ReleaseDate":5249553026427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":1361633280},"MetacriticPlatform":null,"AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxSeriesX":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-series-x/vampire-survivors/"},"MetaScore":{"XboxSeriesX":95},"ID":"9PD5BM2Z8C4L","Title":{"en":"Vampire Survivors"},"Description":{"en":"Vampire Survivors is a time survival game with minimalistic gameplay and roguelite elements.

Fresh out of a three-year prison sentence, an older and weathered Kiryu comes to find out that his surrogate daughter, Haruka, has gone missing from the orphanage he looks after. The trail leads him to his old stomping grounds in Kamurocho, where he discovers that she has been struck by a car and now lies in a coma. To make matters worse, Kiryu learns that Haruka now has a son that he must look after. With baby in hand, Kiryu journeys to the seaside town of Onomichi, Hiroshima to unravel the truth about Haruka, her son, and a sinister secret that the Hiroshima yakuza are harboring.\r\n\r\nFrom the unparalleled realism of the new setting of Onomichi, a beautiful, sleepy port town in Hiroshima Prefecture, to the latest evolution of Kamurocho, the biggest red-light district in Tokyo, Yakuza 6 is the ultimate iteration the game's blend of gritty crime story, hyper-explosive combat, and all the vices and distractions those locales have to offer.\r\n\r\nEnter the “Dragon Engine” - Explore the world of Yakuza like never before. Yakuza 6 is the first current-gen Yakuza title that was developed from the ground up for the current-gen hardware, introducing the seedy Japanese underworld with detailed visuals, lifelike animations, a new physics engine, interactive storefronts, seamless transitions and more.\r\n\r\nExplore Kamurocho Reborn and the Scenic Views of Onomichi - The hypnotic lights, opportunistic inhabitants, and hedonistic distractions of Kamurocho look better than ever. Revamped minigames like karaoke, batting cages, darts, hostesses, and the SEGA arcade have been streamlined for maximum pleasure, and new additions like the RIZAP Gym, Cat Café, and Clan Creator are the purrfect distractions after a long night of bashing heads! But it’s also time to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life to play tourist in beautiful Onomichi. This tranquil coastal community is home to plenty of local activities like bar mingling, spearfishing (think action-packed rail shooter … with fish), and more!\r\n\r\nLet the Bodies Hit the Floor - Yakuza 6 Kiryu is a 100% certified badass, so that means he’s a battle-hardened veteran when it comes to the art of street fighting. Although he utilizes one fighting style this time around, you best believe Kiryu hits like a truck.
