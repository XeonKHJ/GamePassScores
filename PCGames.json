They gather around sects, institutions which train their bodies, minds and souls to be worth eternal life. But in return for such great power, you must be willing to guard the balance between good and evil -- no matter the cost.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, greed is inherent to human nature, so it also blinds cultivators. Your master didn’t realize until it was too late, and the Taiyi Sect burnt to the ground for his mistake. Your brothers and sisters will never come back, but the Taiyi Sect can still be reborn from its ashes. Its seeds are scattered around Tiancang, waiting for you to find them. This is what your grandmaster would have wanted. You must do it for him ─ and for all those we sworn to protect.\r\n\r\nSet in the fictional Tiancang era, Amazing Cultivation Simulator brings to you the magic of Asian mythology through a strategy game with strong xianxia nuances, a Chinese literary genre which is deeply influenced by Taoist and Buddhist concepts, as well as folklore and traditional knowledge on medicine and martial arts. Its gameplay is inspired by famous games like Rimworld and Dwarf Fortress, as well as The Legend of Shushan Swordsman and Martial Kingdoms.\r\n\r\nAs a grandmaster, you’ll bring the Taiyi Sect back to its glory days by training new apprentices, gathering knowledge and expanding your domain through commerce and political alliances to gain influence over other sects.

Design, build, and manage the city of your dreams, from public services to civic policies, and challenge yourself to grow from a simple town to a bustling metropolitan hub.\r\n\r\nCities: Skylines is an award-winning, best-selling management game, now available for Windows 10 with all of its robust city-simulation gameplay and unique charm along for the ride. The Windows 10 Edition includes the base game and the popular After Dark expansion, allowing players to plan and design for their cities’ nightlife and tourist attractions.\r\n\r\nMain Features:\r\n- Build the city of your dreams: Plan road networks, bus lines and parks. Bring on a smog-filled industrial revolution or create a quiet beach town ideal for tourists powered by renewable energy. Bring education, healthcare and safety to your citizens. Build it your way!\r\n\r\n- Multi-tiered and challenging simulation: Playing as the mayor of your city, you’ll be faced with balancing essential requirements such as education, water electricity, police, firefighting, healthcare and much more, along with your city’s economy. Citizens within your city react fluidly, keeping you on your toes with ever-evolving demands.\r\n\r\n- Extensive local traffic simulation: Managing traffic and the needs of your citizens to work and play will require the use of several interactive transport systems – use careful road planning alongside buses, trains, subways, and much more.\r\n\r\n- Districts and policies: Be more than just another city hall official! Create a car-free downtown area, assign free public transport to your waterfront, or ban pets in suburbia. Designate parts of your city as a district in order to set policy at the local level, and give different parts of town their own personalities.\r\n\r\n- After Dark included: Watch your city become an entirely different place at night: a day-night cycle will have your citizens seeking out places to unwind after work. Add in new policies and zones to create popular hotspots and provide enough taxis and trains to get to and from the clubs!\r\n"},"Affirmations":[],"MetaCriticPathName":"cities-skylines","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38447.14442149246756025.e0e6c583-8325-415d-813c-e90e0ab7057a.309e5a51-4e69-41a1-8d19-d19c72140230","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5247993506427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":15352951102},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure","Role playing"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/citizen-sleeper/"},"MetaScore":{"PC":82},"ID":"9N6F97F9WGL0","Title":{"en":"Citizen Sleeper"},"Description":{"en":"ROLEPLAYING IN THE RUINS OF INTERPLANETARY CAPITALISM\r\n\r\nFrom the developer of In Other Waters, and featuring the stunning character art of Guillaume Singelin, Citizen Sleeper is a narrative RPG set on Erlin’s Eye, a ruined space station that is home to thousands of people trying to survive on the edges of an interstellar capitalist society.\r\n\r\nYou are a sleeper, a digitised human consciousness in an artificial body, owned by a corporation that wants you back. Thrust amongst the unfamiliar and colourful inhabitants of the Eye, you need to build friendships, earn your keep, and navigate the factions of this strange metropolis, if you hope to survive to see the next cycle.\r\n\r\nLIFE ON ERLIN'S EYE\r\nAn abandoned station on the edge of a system in crisis. Now it is held together by anarchic alliances, ramshackle factions and a shared desire to be free from corporate control.\r\n\r\nDO THE WORK. GET PAID. SURVIVE.\r\nEach cycle you choose what to do with your time. Make or break alliances, uncover truths and escape your hunters. Survive and ultimately thrive, one cycle at a time.\r\n\r\nTURN UP FOR FRIENDS\r\nThe Eye plays host to characters from all walks of life. Salvagers, engineers, hackers and more - each has a history. You choose who to help, and together shape your future.\r\n\r\nACCESS THEIR SECRETS\r\nHack the station’s cloud to access data, new areas and secrets. This is your power, and it can change your future.

True to Citizen Sleeper’s TTRPG roots, these three episodes will offer an expansive campaign module that tells the longest and most complex story to be featured in the game to date. \r\n\r\nIn the first episode, FLUX, the first ships from a refugee flotilla arrive at Erlin’s Eye in response to pressures in the Helion system.

Throw fire on top of oil to burn monsters and mix lightning with water to electrocute your foes. There are a lot of lethal combinations to explore and use to slay monsters you encounter.\r\n\r\nLearn Skills from your Enemy\r\n\r\nThroughout your quest, you will encounter elite monsters, equipped with elite skills, known as Familiars.

Choose your noble house and lead your dynasty to greatness in a Middle Ages epic that spans generations. War is but one of many tools to establish your reign, as real strategy requires expert diplomatic skill, mastery of your realm, and true cunning. Crusader Kings III continues the popular series made by Paradox Development Studio, featuring the widely acclaimed marriage of immersive grand strategy and deep, dramatic medieval roleplaying. \r\n\r\n\r\nA bloodline begins\r\n  \r\n• Take command of your house and expand your dynasty through a meticulously researched Middle Ages. Begin in 867 or 1066 and claim lands, titles, and vassals to secure a realm worthy of your royal blood. Your death is only a footnote as your lineage continues with new playable heirs, either planned… or not. \r\n• Discover a sprawling simulated world teeming with peasants and knights, courtiers, spies, knaves and jesters, and secret love affairs. An extensive cast of historical characters can be romanced, betrayed, executed, or subtly influenced.  \r\n• Explore a vast medieval map stretching from the snowswept Nordic lands to the Horn of Africa, and the British Isles in the west to the exotic riches of Burma in the east. Claim, conquer, and rule thousands of unique counties, duchies, kingdoms, and empires. \r\n\r\n\r\nLarger than life \r\n\r\n• Each character is larger than life, with traits and lifestyle choices determining their actions and schemes. Prompt fear and dread as you rule with an iron fist, or inspire your subjects with magnanimous deeds. Genetics can be passed along to your children, be it the gift of genius or crippling stupidity. \r\n• Groom your heir with the appropriate guardians or educate them yourself. If found wanting, marry them off or despatch them through other means. \r\n• Customize your ruler and noble house, from appearance to attributes, and create a monarch worthy of all their inherited virtues and vices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReal strategy requires cunning\r\n\r\n• Govern an ever-evolving realm and grant titles to whom you see fit - or usurp your liege to claim their crown as your own. Be wary of rivals, from restless serfs to revengeful concubines. \r\n• The shadows stir frequently, and danger lurks around every darkened corner. Recruit agents and other unsavory elements to undermine, blackmail, or murder those who stand in your path. Or be inspired by the bard and ballad, and seduce your way to power and influence.\r\n• Blood will flow. Assemble men-at-arms units and powerful knights. Manage your battlefield tactics and armies. Raid and plunder nearby lands or hire mercenaries and Holy Orders for your major conflicts. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccomplish great things\r\n\r\n• Be a pious king to invite the religious powers to your side, or design your own faith as you battle between everlasting fame or eternal damnation.\r\n• Bring novel innovations to your culture and construct mighty castles and bastions to increase the wealth, prestige, and security of your realm. \r\n• The paths to follow are limitless: experience thousands of dynamic events and life-altering decisions tailored to each and every conceivable situation and character. There are countless ways of securing and keeping your place in the history books. \r\n\r\n"},"Affirmations":[],"MetaCriticPathName":"crusader-kings-iii","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25959.14065406176999862.d433bba3-dfb8-463a-bd60-0c7bd30829d8.8a527e59-eb28-4692-a0cf-f4be29c66f58","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5249031746427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":9302552576},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Shooter"],"MetacriticUrls":{"Xbox360":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/crysis-3/"},"MetaScore":{"Xbox360":76},"ID":"9PNRHXZ6ZSS9","Title":{"en":"Crysis 3"},"Description":{"en":"The fate of the world is in your hands.

Fortunately, your offense is equally unique, as the high-powered mining tools at your disposal provide the means to fight against the threat.\r\n\r\nGame Features:\r\n\r\nMessy monster slaying.

Switch things up with alternate fire modes, and purchase upgrades to increase ammo, power, and reload speed.\r\n\r\nReal-time attacks. Whatever you do, don’t drop your guard.

Now you can download Dead Space 2 to your PC and give yourself more reasons to sleep with both eyes open.\r\n\r\nIsaac Clarke’s story continues as he wakes from a coma in a city simply known as “The Sprawl.” Before he can get his bearings, the city is attacked by Necromorphs, the same creatures that made his life a bone-chilling hell the first time around. Confused, disoriented, and scared out of his mind, Isaac must battle the hideous creatures that have driven him insane.\r\n\r\nAlong with better weapons and more zero-gravity environments, Dead Space 2 takes away the silent protagonist and gives Isaac a voice, letting the player hear his reactions to horror that surrounds him.

In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop.\r\n\r\nIF AT FIRST YOU DON’T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN \r\nEvery new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you’ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you’ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted.\r\n\r\nSINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER \r\nAre you the hero or the villain? You’ll experience DEATHLOOP’s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you’ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you’re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna’s stylish sneakers and invade another player’s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign.\r\n\r\nTHE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF – PARADISE OR PRISON    \r\nArkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself.

Set in Frank Herbert’s groundbreaking Dune universe, you must lead your faction and battle for control and dominance over the harsh desert planet of Arrakis.\r\n\r\nSpice is the most valuable resource in the universe. The spice extends life, expands consciousness, and makes interstellar travel possible. Found only on Arrakis, it is sought by the most influential forces in the universe. Play as one of several factions, including House Atreides, House Harkonnen, House Corrino, the Smugglers, and the native Fremen, and compete for power over Dune and the spice.\r\n\r\nScan the landscape for wormsign or risk losing your troops and spice harvesters to titanic sandworms who will burst through the dunes to swallow and devour them whole. Crush your opponents in combat, best them through political intrigue, and undermine them with your network of illusive spies.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank Herbert’s Dune\r\nExperience the unique Dune universe, one of the most influential sci-fi settings ever created. Lead your faction to victory with iconic characters, such as Duke Leto Atreides, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, Esmar Tuek, and Liet Kynes. Stay alert as opposing factions seek to gain the upper hand and the planet itself threatens with withering deserts, huge storms, and consuming sandworms.\r\n\r\nForge your own path to victory\r\nBalance open warfare, subterfuge, political influence, and economic supremacy to prevail and gain control over the most important planet in the universe! Use secretive agents to sabotage the plans of your opponents. Vote on political resolutions in the Landsraad to further your strategy.\r\n\r\n4X in real-time   \r\nExplore Dune with ornithopters to discover resources, villages, and points of interest. Expand with your troops to take control of more and more regions. Exploit the resources through buildings and spice harvesters to dominate the economy. Deploy your spaceships and aircrafts to exterminate your enemies but beware as outright aggression can have high political repercussions.\r\n\r\nChoose your faction\r\nTake the path of honor and political power as the respected House Atreides, or choose violence and devious plots as House Harkonnen. Become master of desert survival and guerilla tactics with the native Fremen and gain influence through shady deals and infiltration as the Smugglers, or eliminate any threats to your rule and assert your domination over the spice trade as the imperial House Corrino.\r\nTailor each faction’s existing strengths and weaknesses by selecting your councilors. With the Atreides’ legendary swordmaster Duncan Idaho at your side, expansion and combat prowess are improved. Gain power over people and information with the aid of Chani Kynes of the Fremen, or overwhelm with military might with Rabban of the Harkonnens. Increase your influence in the Imperium, by involving Corrino’s Princess Irulan in your plots.\r\n\r\nUp to 4-player Multiplayer\r\nBand together in 2v2 matches or face each other in a free-for-all of up to four players. Tailor the parameters of your multiplayer match to your preferences, including AI difficulty, map size, victory conditions, and the aggression of sandworms, storms, and Sietches. Team up and try different faction combinations to find synergies and dominate Arrakis.\r\n\r\n\r\nFull details on the latest status of the game, how you can give feedback and report issues can be found at spicewars.dunegames.com."},"Affirmations":[],"MetaCriticPathName":"dune-spice-wars-game-preview","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":0,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31146.13993061156496216.d6ff38b2-5a4b-454e-919b-3b4a69116795.749d3fe6-6d45-4a8e-9c1b-6a2fc9862d72","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":false,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":false,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5249728958427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":3761401856},"MetacriticPlatform":null,"AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure","Strategy"],"MetacriticUrls":{},"MetaScore":{},"ID":"9PKDX735TR8K","Title":{"en":"Dungeon Keeper™"},"Description":{"en":"Raid dungeons, earn sweet loot and save the day – that’s what adventurers do, and it’s your job to stop them!

In the multiplayer social deduction game Eville you find yourself in a village riddled by a series of murders. Some say it might have been you - or was it? Convince others you're not a murderer to stay alive!\r\n\r\nInspired by popular social-deduction party games such as Werewolves this is a new take on the concept with realtime gameplay and interaction. Take on the role of a Villager or Conspirator and do your deeds when no one is watching. Place wards to observe other players or tread through the village to visit any house and go on a killing spree. It is your task to communicate with other players and prove your innocence. Use your unique role abilities to your advantage and make sure your team survives.\r\n\r\nDevious murders are taking place in the once peaceful village of Eville.

The farther you travel, the more you’ll learn about your ship’s fascinating complexities.\r\n\r\nA MEDITATIVE EXPERIENCE\r\nFAR: Changing Tides’ moments of peril and intrigue are delivered by environmental dangers and puzzles to overcome, but these feed into the solitary, almost meditative approach to gameplay.

Some nay-sayers have called the magnifying glass \"useless\", but what do they know? \r\n\r\nIn Case 1, The Haunted Island, a sloth has been haunted for weeks by a mysterious ghost that nobody can seem to track down. Even after hiring a team of ghost scientists, the mystery is no closer to being solved. Luckily for this tropical sloth, and unluckily for this pesky ghost, Frog Detective is here to crack the case! The Haunted Island is the first in this award-winning series, and this bite-sized mystery is what started an international cult obsession with the world of Frog Detective.\r\n\r\nIn the second mystery, The Case of the Invisible Wizard, we follow the Detective to Warlock Woods, where a celebratory parade for their newest neighbour has been maliciously destroyed. Now the neighbour is nowhere to be seen, and the town is in ruin. Can Frog Detective get to the bottom of things? We sure hope so, otherwise the game would be a bummer. \r\n\r\nIn the exciting series finale, Corruption at Cowboy County, The Detective and Lobster Cop are tasked to solve the conundrum of a sheriff-less town. But not all is as it seems here, when a surprisingly simple solution to the case reveals a sinister scheme. Maybe crime is real after all... \r\nThis final mystery is jam-packed with twists and turns, a true love letter to the Frog Detective fans.\r\n\r\nFrog Detective: The Entire Mystery is a family-friendly yet witty take on the detective game genre. Solve the mysteries on your own, or play along with friends as you take turns reading out the dialogue.

It’s a society survival game that asks what people are capable of when pushed to the brink of extinction. In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. The city’s ruler has to manage both the citizens and the infrastructure they live in. The leader’s tactical skills face challenges that will frequently question morality and the basic foundations of what we consider organized society. Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the ruler’s time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and present state.\r\n\r\nWhat decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And...\r\n\r\n...who will you become in the process?\r\n\r\nMAKE THE LAW\r\nSociety is a group of people who abide by the same rules and share similar beliefs. Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe.\r\n\r\nWEIGH UP YOUR CHOICES\r\nSome of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. Leadership can be a burden.\r\n\r\nDEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES\r\nSurvival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills.\r\n\r\nEXPLORE THE FROSTLAND\r\nWhile New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society’s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.\r\n\r\nSHAPE YOUR SOCIETY\r\nIf you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Whichever you choose, remember: there’s no turning back.\r\n\r\nGO BEYOND THE CAMPAIGN\r\nThe main story campaign can go different ways depending on your playstyle, but it is still not the only challenge to tackle. Frostpunk offers different scenarios and additional updates with new content will be added in the future."},"Affirmations":[],"MetaCriticPathName":"frostpunk","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60016.14372914980969275.d331a64f-b3f1-4a83-91cf-cb9cce9ce027.2a30409a-59be-488d-9ccb-822b8974b208","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5248287770427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":9621059778},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Role playing"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/fuga-melodies-of-steel/"},"MetaScore":{"PC":84},"ID":"9NLX3GWW0HF1","Title":{"en":"Fuga: Melodies of Steel"},"Description":{"en":"\"We have to fight!

It may or may not change over time or release as a final product. Purchase only if you are comfortable with the current state of the unfinished game.\r\n\r\nGhostlore is an 'Eastpunk' Action-RPG where you fight monsters from Southeast-Asian folklore. Inspired by timeless classic ARPG's such as Diablo 2 and Titan Quest, Ghostlore features a detailed item and character customization system, procedurally generated maps, and beautiful 2D isometric art.\r\n\r\nLORE COMES TO LIFE\r\nThe bloodthirsty Penanggal is a gruesome creature of with origins in Malay folklore. It comprises of nothing more than a disembodied head and dangling entrails. The Indonesian Babi Ngepet myth tells of sorcerors who sacrifice their humanity in order to become boar demons. The tales of Hungry Ghosts are superstitions brought over by Chinese immigrants - undead horrors cursed to remain forever hungry due to their greed in mortal life.\r\n\r\nStories from the maritime region of Southeast-Asia are full of all manner of nightmarish, horrifying creatures. Are you brave enough to face them? Discover over 40 different enemies, each with their quirks and tactics to defeat based on their descriptions in folklore.\r\n\r\nA WORLD LIKE NO OTHER\r\nExplore a procedurally generated world that takes inspiration from the developers' home country of Singapore, its two closest neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia, and the rest of Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\nPlayers unfamiliar with the region will get to experience a culture that is underrepresented and rarely seen in other forms of media. Players who live in Southeast Asia will find plenty of things they recognize - such as the food! Collect and prepare various meals to boost your stats. Don't fight on an empty stomach!\r\n\r\nMULTI CLASS SYSTEM\r\nGhostlore allows you to mix-and-match abilities from 3 out of 6 character classes to create your own unique hero. The 6 classes are:\r\n\r\nThe Adept: Mystic warriors skilled in Martial Arts, honing their mind as well as their body.\r\nThe Exorcist: Able to sense the spirit world with ESP and cast out evil spirits.\r\nThe Feral: Fearless fighters bestowed with the power of blood magic and the ability to transform into a Weretiger.\r\nThe Geomancer: Masters of the art of bending the elemental forces of Earth, Fire, Ice and Lightning to their will.\r\nThe Hashashin: Shadowy assassins who rely on speed and stealth to take down opponents.\r\nThe Sentinel: Keepers of the forest with the ability to communicate with animals.\r\n\r\nGLYPH SYSTEM\r\nThe Glyph system is where Ghostlore brings something truly new to the Action-RPG table. In your travels you will find Glyphs - magical symbols that you can inscribe onto your body to gain new powers.\r\n\r\nEach Glyph takes up space on your body (represented in game as a grid). As your level increases, so do the number of glyphs you can inscribe onto yourself.\r\n\r\nHere's where things get interesting: Compound glyphs are rare and special glyphs that use 5 normal glyph spaces, but grant additional bonuses to glyphs that are placed within their configuration. Plan your Compound Glyph layout in order to maximise stat bonuses!\r\n\r\nWEAPONS AND AMULETS\r\nIn Ghostlore, you can wield a variety of weapons prevalent in Southeast-Asian martial arts:\r\n\r\nThe Kris or Keris - a blade with a distinctively wavy shape. It is a well-balanced weapon.\r\nThe Bow and Arrow has been a staple of hunting since the dawn of time; apparently they come in handy with ghost-hunting as well!\r\nParangs, also known as machetes, are cleaving blades with a wide arc.\r\nThe deadly Kukri knives are the fastest attacking melee weapons in the game.\r\nThe trusty Spear has the longest reach out of all the melee weapons.\r\nFinally, there are enchanted Talismans that can fly and give foes nasty papercuts.\r\n\r\nIn addition, you can find and equip a variety of Amulets. Amulets are commonly sold in many parts of real world Southeast Asia as good luck charms. In the world of Ghostlore, their power is very, very real. Equipping the right Amulet for the situation can mean the difference between a glorious victory and an untimely demise.\r\n\r\nNEVER FIGHT ALONE\r\nLocal co-op multiplier lets you play with up to 4 of your friends on the same screen.\r\nThe Shrine of Balance is an optional asynchronous multiplayer feature which lets you help other players by sending them equipment. You have better chances of good loot in return when they use your equipment."},"Affirmations":[],"MetaCriticPathName":"ghostlore-game-preview","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":0,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33050.14552973818515582.708229a3-74f2-492c-ad4d-b3e086fcb7e5.fa4b8274-3c36-43bc-8157-972085f597eb","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":false,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":false,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5249728418427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":527101952},"MetacriticPlatform":null,"AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure","Simulation"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/goat-simulator/"},"MetaScore":{"PC":62},"ID":"9MXWKHJ3VZZH","Title":{"en-us":"Goat Simulator Windows 10"},"Description":{"en-us":"Goat Simulator is the latest in goat simulation technology, bringing next-gen goat simulation to YOU.

It has been compared to an old-school skating game, except instead of being a skater, you're a goat, and instead of doing tricks, you wreck stuff.

Inside the secluded borders of this land, an unholy court of vampires feast on the blood of their human subjects. And, as long as they give it willingly, a vicious peace between mortal and immortal is kept alive under the watchful eye of the vampiric rulers - Vlad and Cecilia Dracul, forever bound by eternal love.\r\n\r\nTo the east, a cold wind blows over the desolate planes of Mourterra – The Land of the Dead. No humans live on this barren and cursed soil, and yet the land is far from deserted. Horrifying remnants of the ancient and corrupt Nosfernus bloodline stalk here in silence, patiently waiting for their chance to once again plague the lands of the living. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in Esain - The Frozen North, another bloodline of vampires resides in solitude and isolation from the world. For the mystical clan of the Moroia, magic is blood, and blood is magic... and it runs thick in their cold, blue veins. No being – living or dead – dares interrupt their dark rituals and bloody soirées.\r\n\r\nTonight, the smell of blood is strong on the wind, and a red moon lights up the dark sky. A new vampire war is imminent, and none will be spared from the coming horrors.\r\n\r\nImmortal Realms: Vampire Wars is an engaging strategy game set in a dark vampire world in turmoil, that combines empire management and turn-based combat with unique card-game elements.

Those who are already lost may find their way to a secret highway winding through underground caves. The people who live and work along this highway are themselves a little strange at first, but soon seem familiar: the aging driver making the last delivery for a doomed antique shop; the young woman who fixes obsolete TVs surrounded by ghosts; the child and his giant eagle companion; the robot musicians; the invisible power company lurking everywhere, and the threadbare communities who struggle against its grip.\r\n\r\nKENTUCKY ROUTE ZERO: TV EDITION is a magical realist adventure game in five acts, featuring a haunting electronic score, and a suite of hymns and bluegrass standards recorded by The Bedquilt Ramblers. Rendered in a striking visual style that draws as much from theater, film, and experimental electronic art as it does from the history of videogames, this is a story of unpayable debts, abandoned futures, and the human drive to find community.\r\n\r\nOriginally published episodically over a span of years, the TV Edition collects all five acts along with the \"interludes,\" which were originally published separately, available now on Xbox One for the first time. Also for the first time, it has been painstakingly localized for French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Spanish (both European Spanish and Latin American)."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"kentucky-route-zero","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26811.14620558670939884.b282563f-ef8a-4a4d-8cd6-6780477a8cf6.458a2928-67d4-4818-84ec-6a54b943852d","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5248843682427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":1809358848},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure","Shooter","Simulation"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/kill-it-with-fire/"},"MetaScore":{"PC":68},"ID":"9MZVSHQZ666K","Title":{"en":"Kill It With Fire"},"Description":{"en":"The spider - mankind’s most ancient and deadly nemesis.

As Meredith, you get to decide who to talk to, who to befriend and perhaps even start a romantic relationship with.\r\n\r\nWhatever happens, at the end of her stint she'll have to make up her mind: return to her demanding job in the big city, or stay in the town she grew up in?\r\n"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"lake","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13898.14038361809481235.e1ae8557-13ac-43d8-8e4b-bc0fcab05ea7.64fb0f98-88bc-4352-b524-88202efe3de7","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41087.14038361809481235.d87a9a19-dc97-4d6d-96de-9822f1aa65da.6fe9cdf2-89d2-4908-a3e5-5faddfc42783","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51866.14038361809481235.d87a9a19-dc97-4d6d-96de-9822f1aa65da.d5109d19-c0ba-44d1-9d82-aca473829281","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62509.14038361809481235.d87a9a19-dc97-4d6d-96de-9822f1aa65da.b6cfe6be-f03e-47c0-aaa3-596d4708f98c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48354.14038361809481235.d87a9a19-dc97-4d6d-96de-9822f1aa65da.b4b57573-95ac-4c3f-8c3b-fbef4acfa72f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9620.14038361809481235.d87a9a19-dc97-4d6d-96de-9822f1aa65da.8174b5d6-38fc-4524-840b-4304a7726094","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50869.14038361809481235.d87a9a19-dc97-4d6d-96de-9822f1aa65da.95e7a863-193c-4cb0-9a3b-f18b7971af10","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11944.14038361809481235.d87a9a19-dc97-4d6d-96de-9822f1aa65da.f87d9a08-7819-4ab9-802f-ee1135462d67","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55700.14038361809481235.d87a9a19-dc97-4d6d-96de-9822f1aa65da.43b10f10-9428-4650-81bd-3ba90b694304","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24383.14038361809481235.d87a9a19-dc97-4d6d-96de-9822f1aa65da.4c07c9c1-a99f-489b-99be-937e61ce37c5"],"ReleaseDate":5249346998427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":2576572416},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure","Platformer"],"MetacriticUrls":{},"MetaScore":{},"ID":"9NBQHM0GM30N","Title":{"en-us":"LAPIN (Game Preview)"},"Description":{"en-us":"This game is a work in progress.

No other game covers as many authentic World War II vehicles as Panzer Corps 2!\r\n\r\nAll of World War II at your fingertips\r\nPanzer Corps 2 comes with a massive branching campaign including around 60 scenarios: lead the Wehrmacht in the entirety of World War II, carrying over your battle-hardened veterans from one battle to the next. 4 additional single player scenarios are available and another 10 scenarios carefully designed for a balanced Multiplayer experience. On top of that there is an advanced random map generator for Skirmish mode, offering six distinct map types and four mission types.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate wargame online experience\r\nChallenge your friends or play on coop against the AI. Panzer Corps 2 offers a wide range of Multiplayer options: hot seat, server-assisted play-by-email (Slitherine’s PBEM++) mode, and a true online Multiplayer. In the latter mode it is even possible to play your turns simultaneously with your coop partner, which basically reduces waiting times to zero!\r\n\r\nA comprehensive editor\r\nModding was always big with Panzer Corps series. For this reason, Panzer Corps 2 includes the most powerful Scenario Editor we have ever created, which is also very user friendly and easy to use. Using the Editor, you can create your own campaigns, single scenarios and multiplayer maps in no time, or you can enjoy content created by fellow players. If the prequel game is any indication, literally hundreds of user-made scenarios will be available for Panzer Corps 2 in no time, for unlimited replayability!\r\n"},"Affirmations":[],"MetaCriticPathName":"panzer-corps-2","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30049.14303893402480690.13bdc421-bbf9-499e-9721-e858e181608b.815fb463-e773-456a-9129-01fb70c8dc78","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5249539202427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":14639423488},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure","Puzzle & trivia"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/paradise-killer/"},"MetaScore":{"PC":81},"ID":"9N673ZL1TCS7","Title":{"en":"Paradise Killer"},"Description":{"en":"An island outside of reality.

It may or may not change over time or release as a final product. Purchase only if you are comfortable with the current state of the unfinished game.\r\n\r\nPhantom Abyss is a massive asynchronous multiplayer game that casts players into procedurally-generated temples and tasks them with retrieving the sacred relics hidden within deadly chambers. Intrepid adventurers will dodge scores of hidden traps, leap treacherous chasms, and flee relentless guardians through branching paths until one of the relics are claimed or the devices of death overwhelm them. Be warned, you only get one attempt at each temple and failure or settling for a lesser relic means you will never see that temple again...\r\n\r\nThe cleverest players will use the phantom runs of failed attempts from other players to their advantage and avoid the missteps and mistakes that led to their doom. Once the legendary relic at the bottom of each temple is found, the temple goes away forever and becomes the priceless trophy of the skilled adventurer.\r\n\r\nAsynchronous Multiplayer\r\nExplore the perilous halls and colossal rooms of each temple alongside the phantoms of fallen players that came before you. Use their successes and failures to your advantage to progress deeper than they ever could have hoped.\r\n\r\nUnlock More Treacherous Floors\r\nRecover keys from chests to unlock deeper, deadlier sections of the temple that house more coveted relics. The more difficult a relic is to obtain, the greater the reward - the final Legendary Relic of a temple allows you to claim the whole temple so that it's gone forever.\r\n\r\nBlessings from the Gods\r\nAs adventurers venture further into a temple, offerings of collected treasures can be made at altars to gain a new blessing for the rest of the run. Collect as much treasure as you can to please the gods and gain a double jump, glide jump, extended slide, damage protection, and more!\r\n\r\nUnlockable Whips\r\nUnlock new whips with success and choose from your collection before venturing into your next run. Each whips carries a minor blessing but also a curse that may complicate your attempt at riches and glory.\r\n\r\nFull details on the latest status of the game, how you can give feedback and report issues can be found at https://www.phantomabyss.com/"},"Affirmations":[],"MetaCriticPathName":"phantom-abyss-game-preview","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56545.13633827486627594.07290a41-f96f-4e82-b3f2-145174a6351a.d48b6ff1-9c9a-4e1a-9a03-7c59d51483fb","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":false,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":false,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5249704226427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":2574901248},"MetacriticPlatform":null,"AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Classics","Role playing","Simulation","Strategy"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/phoenix-point/"},"MetaScore":{"PC":74},"ID":"9P1P5Q3BNM7J","Title":{"en":"Phoenix Point"},"Description":{"en":"Phoenix Point puts players in the midst of a desperate fight to take back the Earth from a mutating, alien menace. Featuring turn-based tactical combat on procedurally generated maps, and resource management on a global scale, Phoenix Point offers endless replayability and a brutal challenge.\r\n\r\nFollowing a global environmental disaster, the Pandoravirus appeared and began reshaping creatures, including humans, into hideous mutants. Unable to stop the progress of the virus, much of human civilization was wiped out -- only small enclaves remain, separated by their principles and the vast landscape. The Phoenix Project, an ancient failsafe against global catastrophe is the only hope to unite mankind and take back the planet.\r\n\r\nLead the Phoenix Project from its base at Phoenix Point. Research and develop new technologies and techniques, plan operations, build alliances to unite the planet-- or simply destroy your rivals. It's up to you to save the planet and rebuild civilization, but there may be much more to the alien threat than meets the eye.\r\n\r\n* Mutating Alien Menace: Face down an ever-changing alien threat that adapts to your tactics and offers no respite even as your team becomes more powerful and technologically advanced.\r\n\r\n* Uncover the Secrets of the Pandoravirus: Phoenix Point features a complex narrative, with multiple endings that the player can only uncover via multiple playthroughs. Discover a secret history, as you learn about the origins of the mutants, the Pandoravirus, and Phoenix Point itself through exploration, diplomacy, and research.\r\n\r\n* Manage Diplomatic Relations: The Phoenix Project is not the only organization trying to reclaim the Earth. The militaristic New Jericho, the mystical Disciples of Anu, and the technophiles of Synedrion all offer unique rewards for co-operation and threats for opposition. It is up to you to decide how, or even if, to deal with them.\r\n\r\n* Take Aim on the Battlefield: In addition to equipping and commanding units, Phoenix Point lets you take direct control of your soldier's shots in combat, with a unique free-aiming system. Target enemy weakspots, weapons, or valuables, or just go for center mass.\r\n\r\n* Next-Gen Tech with Classic Pedigree: Phoenix Point was designed by Julian Gollop, the creator of the X-COM series in the 1990s. Keeping the core ethos of X-COM while updating the visuals, technology, and systems to modern standards has made Phoenix Point best-in-class."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"phoenix-point","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23750.14507726714197033.ea391b48-d8cb-4724-a6cb-765168bd5161.0029c50b-c234-475e-9928-0185fc83e0aa","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27297.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.8f0d79d4-fb71-4169-bb64-0b77cac69f7f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3522.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.17680a69-6b0d-4293-a53c-6d16fe0035fd","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39128.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.c1af4919-7997-458a-ae19-4b9cf83ecfaa","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63541.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.c3d3f2f0-5855-4872-bbdd-720b19605e27","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34869.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.dd0e9d28-4298-463e-98c1-032a9fa45f9c"],"ReleaseDate":5248809122427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":25358311424},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Platformer"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/pikuniku/"},"MetaScore":{"PC":74},"ID":"9N8QNKN5ZKTH","Title":{"en":"Pikuniku Win10"},"Description":{"en":"Pikuniku is an absurdly wonderful puzzle-exploration game that takes place in a strange but playful world where not everything is as happy as it seems.

Those who rebel against the coalition take on a purely militant view, coming to the opinion that the only way to bring peace is by ultimately crushing all who oppose them - especially xenos.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in their history, the war creates a schism in the Advent Unity. The loyalists seek to continue their policy of revenge against the Traders, and to assimilate all others to the Unity’s influence. However, others amongst the Advent suspect that a corrupting influence from within has diverted the Unity from its proper destiny.\r\n\r\nThe divide created in the Vasari Empire is less pronounced, but just as severe to their people. With the Vasari now practically frantic to move on to new space, the loyalist faction abandons cooperation and decides to take the resources they need by any means necessary. Having accepted the need to work together, the rebel faction feels that their best chance for survival is to work with the other races and bring them along to flee the approaching enemy.\r\n\r\nTake the battle for galactic supremacy to its ultimate level in Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion – a standalone RT4X game that combines the tactics of real-time strategy with the depth of the 4X genre (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate)."},"Affirmations":[],"MetaCriticPathName":"sins-of-a-solar-empire-rebellion","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3586.13947402644023850.2b520969-4963-4db1-8249-4b43ce5f244b.8348d7aa-5b66-484d-be31-7c635de4ccbe","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5249625602427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":4479705088},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure","Platformer"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/skul-the-hero-slayer/"},"MetaScore":{"PC":80},"ID":"9NW4Z3HPJVKW","Title":{"en":"Skul: The Hero Slayer"},"Description":{"en":"Skul is a fast-paced action rogue-lite where losing your head is encouraged.

Roll for initiative, take attacks of opportunity, manage player location and the verticality of the battle field. Set yourself up for the finishing strike and possibly roll a natural 20 at that key moment of battle.​\r\n\r\nIn Solasta, you take control of four heroes, each with unique skills that complement one another. Every hero expresses themselves in the adventure, making each action and dialog choice a dynamic part to the story. Players will create their heroes just as they would in a pen-and-paper game by choosing their race, class, personality and rolling for their stats.​\r\n\r\nYou make the choices, dice decide your destiny.\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nKey Features:\r\n\r\nAn Epic Team Adventure\r\n- Discover the shattered world of Solasta: explore ruins and dungeons for legendary treasures, learn the truth of an age-old cataclysm - and stop it from happening again. \r\n- Create your very own party of adventurers with our Character Creation Tool in the classic tabletop RPG tradition. Breathe life into your heroes, and see their personalities reflected in their dialogue. Tailor your squad to your preferred strategy and maximize your party's abilities. The choice is yours.\r\n\r\nDiscover a Mysterious & Dynamic World\r\n- Delve into long forgotten dungeons to unearth ancient artifacts, but stay watchful of light and darkness: many dangers hide in the dark, but a light can attract monsters. Some enemies have darkvision, some may flee from your torch... Successful adventurers will learn to use it to their advantage. \r\n- Fight monsters in squad-level, turn-based, tactical combat. Solasta's dynamic environment offers some interesting tactical options. Bridges can collapse, leaving enemies stranded and vulnerable. Walls and columns can be pushed over - on top of your foes, if you do it right. The world is your playground.\r\n\r\nPrepare to Think in Three Dimensions\r\n- The dungeons in Solasta are more than flat game-boards. Climb, jump, or fly around obstacles. Evade or surprise foes from above or below. Push them into chasms or drop things on their heads. Position yourself on high grounds to start the fight with an advantage. \r\n- Size also matters. Escape through narrow passages where bigger enemies won't fit and crawl through tunnels to find secret areas. Take advantage of the environment to find cover suited to your own size. Watch out, though - the monsters are also thinking vertically.\r\n\r\nDungeon Maker\r\n- In Solasta, the adventure does not stop after the campaign is over. Unleash your creativity and craft your own dungeons to play using the in-game Dungeon Maker! From the room layout, monster composition and treasure the party will find – down to the decoration and lighting of each room or the music track playing – everything is decided by you.\r\n- Note that the Dungeon Maker is a work in progress and will keep being improved as time goes by, so look forward to more Dungeon Maker features in the future!"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"solasta-crown-of-the-magister","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55762.13899562469464238.c1646c67-46ab-4599-8b51-491c5f064ca0.65fd3add-aefa-4bfe-aab6-067fbeb384ad","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5249263334427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":25148194816},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/soma/"},"MetaScore":{"PC":84},"ID":"C23M2TC1ZFPJ","Title":{"en":"SOMA"},"Description":{"en":"The radio is dead, food is running out, and the machines have started to think they are people.

This narratively-driven single player game puts you in the role of a Jedi Padawan who narrowly escaped the purge of Order 66 following the events of Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith. On a quest to rebuild the Jedi Order, you must pick up the pieces of your shattered past to complete your training, develop new powerful Force abilities, and master the art of the iconic lightsaber - all while staying one step ahead of the Empire and its deadly Inquisitors. \r\n\r\nWhile mastering your abilities, players will engage in cinematically-charged lightsaber and Force combat designed to deliver the kind of intense STAR WARS lightsaber battles as seen in the films. Players will need to approach enemies strategically, sizing up strengths and weaknesses while cleverly utilizing your Jedi training to overcome your opponents and solve the mysteries that lay in your path. \r\n\r\nSTAR WARS fans will recognize iconic locations, weapons, gear, and enemies while also meeting a roster of fresh characters, locations, creatures, droids and adversaries new to STAR WARS. As part of this authentic STAR WARS story, fans will delve into a galaxy recently seized by the Empire. As a Jedi hero-turned-fugitive, players will need to fight for survival while exploring the mysteries of a long-extinct civilization all in an effort to rebuild the remnants of the Jedi Order as the Empire seeks to erase the Jedi completely.\r\n\r\nKEY FEATURES\r\n\r\n● Cinematic, Immersive Combat – Jedi: Fallen Order delivers the fantasy of becoming a Jedi through its innovative lightsaber combat system – striking, parrying, dodging - partnered with a suite of powerful Force abilities you’ll need to leverage to overcome obstacles that stand in your way. This combat system is intuitive to pick up, but takes training and practice to fully master its nuances as you gain new powers and abilities along your adventure.\r\n\r\n● A New Jedi Story Begins - As a former Padawan on the run from the Empire, you must complete your training before Imperial Inquisitors discover your plan to revive the Jedi Order. Aided by a former Jedi Knight, a cantankerous pilot, and a fearless droid, you must escape the evil machinations of the Empire in a story-driven adventure. Explore and overcome a wide range of challenges focused on combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving. \r\n\r\n● The Galaxy Awaits - Ancient forests, windswept rock faces, and haunted jungles are all unique biomes you’ll explore in Jedi: Fallen Order, with the freedom to decide when and where you go next. As you unlock new powers and abilities, opportunities open up to re-traverse maps in new ways; leveraging the Force to augment the way you explore. Move quickly, however, as the Empire is actively hunting your every step in their effort to exterminate all remnants of the Jedi Order.\r\n\r\nConditions and restrictions apply.

Enter a one-way portal to Galatea 37, a distant planet at the far reaches of the Milky Way Galaxy, with the purpose of building up a base that will allow travel back to Earth and further colonization. Ashley's Mecha-suit, which she calls \"Mr. Riggs\", can withstand the harshest environment conditions and has a full range of equipment for base construction, resource extraction, gathering specimens and of course - combat. It is capable of traveling through rifts that connect space across vast distances.\r\n\r\nCAMPAIGN\r\nTake on an epic journey across all the different biomes of Galatea 37. You will establish multiple persistent bases across the globe that will fuel your economy. Research alien substances and lifeforms, as well as fight hordes of alien creatures, clearly not happy with your interference in the natural order of the planet. The campaign spans multiple hours and offers a remarkable degree of freedom in a super detailed, procedurally generated world. You can decide on the order of your priorities and what technologies you want to use. You’re the only human there, after all.\r\n\r\nSURVIVAL\r\nYour mission is to survive a set amount of time, fighting off increasingly difficult waves of enemy creatures. Each mission in the game is randomized, offering nearly endless replayability. \r\n\r\nSANDBOX\r\nIf intense fight for survival is not your thing either, then try out the Sandbox mode, where we give you control over the entire game – including resources, enemy spawns, and weather conditions.\r\n\r\nBASE BUILDING\r\nYour task is to construct a two-way rift back to Earth. It is a very complex invention and requires enormous amounts of energy. Simple solar collectors and a few tons of steel will not be enough. You will need to build up a complex chain of mines, refineries, powerplants and research facilities to complete this mission.\r\n\r\nEXPLORATION\r\nGalatea 37 is an unknown planet in the Sycorax belt of the Milky Way galaxy. Long distance surveys detected that it is inhabitable and perfect for colonization. The planet is full of rare minerals and substances that can be found in various locations around the globe. Varied biomes can surprise you with unknown fauna and flora as well as harsh weather conditions. Construct local outposts, in resource-rich locations that will transport the required resources using the rift technology.\r\n\r\nCUSTOMIZE YOUR GAMEPLAY\r\nThe Riftbreaker™’s gameplay can be customized to fit your playstyle. You can change the frequency of enemy attacks as well as their strength and numbers, resource abundance, weather events, enemy damage, and tons of other settings. There are also multiple difficulty presets to suit the needs of both hardcore strategy players as well as those that want a laid-back base-building experience."},"Affirmations":[],"MetaCriticPathName":"the-riftbreaker","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52293.13746988467631194.70148051-96a5-4cd6-8b2a-276850a15cf4.915f6e0c-7bd8-4a13-b64f-fca80647e95d","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5249383682427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":7191941120},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-saboteur/"},"MetaScore":{"PC":76},"ID":"9PMVJR05PFJW","Title":{"en":"The Saboteur™"},"Description":{"en":"Not all wars are fought on the open battlefield.

Fresh out of a three-year prison sentence, an older and weathered Kiryu comes to find out that his surrogate daughter, Haruka, has gone missing from the orphanage he looks after. The trail leads him to his old stomping grounds in Kamurocho, where he discovers that she has been struck by a car and now lies in a coma. To make matters worse, Kiryu learns that Haruka now has a son that he must look after. With baby in hand, Kiryu journeys to the seaside town of Onomichi, Hiroshima to unravel the truth about Haruka, her son, and a sinister secret that the Hiroshima yakuza are harboring.\r\n\r\nFrom the unparalleled realism of the new setting of Onomichi, a beautiful, sleepy port town in Hiroshima Prefecture, to the latest evolution of Kamurocho, the biggest red-light district in Tokyo, Yakuza 6 is the ultimate iteration the game's blend of gritty crime story, hyper-explosive combat, and all the vices and distractions those locales have to offer.\r\n\r\nEnter the “Dragon Engine” - Explore the world of Yakuza like never before.

Although he utilizes one fighting style this time around, you best believe Kiryu hits like a truck. Devastating combos and bone-breaking Heat Actions make a return, but now the Dragon of Dojima can fill up a meter to engage Extreme Heat Mode. When activated, Kiryu glows blue and unleashes heavy-damage combos with his fists or any “tool” that’s close at hand.\r\n\r\nFully Voiced Japanese Audio - For the first time in series history, every line and piece of dialogue is fully voiced in Japanese.
