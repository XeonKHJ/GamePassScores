Design, build, and manage the city of your dreams, from public services to civic policies, and challenge yourself to grow from a simple town to a bustling metropolitan hub.\r\n\r\nCities: Skylines is an award-winning, best-selling management game, now available for Windows 10 with all of its robust city-simulation gameplay and unique charm along for the ride. The Windows 10 Edition includes the base game and the popular After Dark expansion, allowing players to plan and design for their cities’ nightlife and tourist attractions.\r\n\r\nMain Features:\r\n- Build the city of your dreams: Plan road networks, bus lines and parks. Bring on a smog-filled industrial revolution or create a quiet beach town ideal for tourists powered by renewable energy. Bring education, healthcare and safety to your citizens. Build it your way!\r\n\r\n- Multi-tiered and challenging simulation: Playing as the mayor of your city, you’ll be faced with balancing essential requirements such as education, water electricity, police, firefighting, healthcare and much more, along with your city’s economy. Citizens within your city react fluidly, keeping you on your toes with ever-evolving demands.\r\n\r\n- Extensive local traffic simulation: Managing traffic and the needs of your citizens to work and play will require the use of several interactive transport systems – use careful road planning alongside buses, trains, subways, and much more.\r\n\r\n- Districts and policies: Be more than just another city hall official! Create a car-free downtown area, assign free public transport to your waterfront, or ban pets in suburbia. Designate parts of your city as a district in order to set policy at the local level, and give different parts of town their own personalities.\r\n\r\n- After Dark included: Watch your city become an entirely different place at night: a day-night cycle will have your citizens seeking out places to unwind after work.

Players returning to Erlin’s Eye might even find themselves running into some familiar faces!\r\n\r\n\r\nROLEPLAYING IN THE RUINS OF INTERPLANETARY CAPITALISM\r\nOne of 2022’s most acclaimed indies, the Game Awards-nominated Citizen Sleeper is a Tabletop-inspired narrative RPG set on Erlin’s Eye, a ruined space station that is home to thousands of people trying to survive on the edges of an interstellar capitalist society. \r\n\r\nYou are a sleeper, a digitised human consciousness in an artificial body, owned by a corporation that wants you back. Thrust amongst the unfamiliar and colourful inhabitants of the Eye, you need to build friendships, earn your keep, and navigate the factions of this strange metropolis, if you hope to survive to see the next cycle.\r\n\r\nROLL THE DICE. DO THE WORK. GET PAID. SURVIVE.\r\nInspired by Tabletop Roleplaying games, Citizen Sleeper uses Dice, Clocks and Drives  to create a player-led experience, where you choose your path in a rich and responsive world. Each cycle you use the dice you are dealt to choose what to do with your time. Make or break alliances, uncover truths and escape your hunters. Survive and ultimately thrive, one cycle at a time, and sometimes against the clock!\r\n\r\nTURN UP FOR YOUR FRIENDS\r\nThe station plays host to characters from all walks of life, trying to eke out an existence among the stars. Salvagers, engineers, hackers, bartenders, street-food vendors, each has a history which brought them here. You choose which of them you wish to help, and together you will shape your future.\r\n\r\nACCESS THEIR SECRETS\r\nEventually, you will learn to use your dice to hack into the station’s cloud to access decades of digital data, uncover new areas and unlock secrets. This is your unique power, and with it you can change your future. Corporate secrets, rogue AIs and troves of lost data await those willing to dive into the depths of the station’s networks.\r\n\r\nYOU WERE MADE TO DIE\r\nEssen-Arp: to them you are just property, one more asset in a portfolio that stretches across the stars.

You’ll start from the basics and progressively unlock new more complex dishes and start serving more customers as your fame and experience grow. Once you master the recipes and workflow, you’ll be able to unlock various perks and skills.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you’re not interested in playing by the rules, you’re going to love the Sandbox mode. Access all the recipes and ingredients and prepare whatever you like without any pressure. You don’t even have to cook anything! Game physics gives you unlimited opportunities. Throw knives like darts, set up cutting boards like dominoes, set the whole kitchen on fire, blow up the oven and save the day using a fire extinguisher!\r\n\r\nLeaderboard Challenge. Ever wanted to prove that you are the best chef around? Well, now you can! Pick an order and take it to the kitchen. No distractions, just one simple goal – serve the best dish you can, as fast as you can. Based on this performance, the game will calculate your score and place you on a leaderboard (each recipe has its own). Become an expert at one dish or master them all!"},"Affirmations":[],"MetaCriticPathName":"cooking-simulator","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61226.14318332024941603.bcd56dc7-63bc-4d56-bf05-e25c65cd0318.143a922e-35a6-4bdb-9d8b-3e53a7fca595","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5249644250427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":4997259264},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Role playing","Simulation"],"MetacriticUrls":{},"MetaScore":{},"ID":"9N1T1MQ92PVS","Title":{"en":"Coral Island (Game Preview)"},"Description":{"en":"This game is a work in progress.

Choose your noble house and lead your dynasty to greatness in a Middle Ages epic that spans generations. War is but one of many tools to establish your reign, as real strategy requires expert diplomatic skill, mastery of your realm, and true cunning. Crusader Kings III continues the popular series made by Paradox Development Studio, featuring the widely acclaimed marriage of immersive grand strategy and deep, dramatic medieval roleplaying. \r\n\r\n\r\nA bloodline begins\r\n  \r\n• Take command of your house and expand your dynasty through a meticulously researched Middle Ages. Begin in 867 or 1066 and claim lands, titles, and vassals to secure a realm worthy of your royal blood. Your death is only a footnote as your lineage continues with new playable heirs, either planned… or not. \r\n• Discover a sprawling simulated world teeming with peasants and knights, courtiers, spies, knaves and jesters, and secret love affairs. An extensive cast of historical characters can be romanced, betrayed, executed, or subtly influenced.  \r\n• Explore a vast medieval map stretching from the snowswept Nordic lands to the Horn of Africa, and the British Isles in the west to the exotic riches of Burma in the east. Claim, conquer, and rule thousands of unique counties, duchies, kingdoms, and empires. \r\n\r\n\r\nLarger than life \r\n\r\n• Each character is larger than life, with traits and lifestyle choices determining their actions and schemes. Prompt fear and dread as you rule with an iron fist, or inspire your subjects with magnanimous deeds. Genetics can be passed along to your children, be it the gift of genius or crippling stupidity. \r\n• Groom your heir with the appropriate guardians or educate them yourself. If found wanting, marry them off or despatch them through other means. \r\n• Customize your ruler and noble house, from appearance to attributes, and create a monarch worthy of all their inherited virtues and vices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReal strategy requires cunning\r\n\r\n• Govern an ever-evolving realm and grant titles to whom you see fit - or usurp your liege to claim their crown as your own. Be wary of rivals, from restless serfs to revengeful concubines. \r\n• The shadows stir frequently, and danger lurks around every darkened corner. Recruit agents and other unsavory elements to undermine, blackmail, or murder those who stand in your path. Or be inspired by the bard and ballad, and seduce your way to power and influence.\r\n• Blood will flow. Assemble men-at-arms units and powerful knights. Manage your battlefield tactics and armies. Raid and plunder nearby lands or hire mercenaries and Holy Orders for your major conflicts. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccomplish great things\r\n\r\n• Be a pious king to invite the religious powers to your side, or design your own faith as you battle between everlasting fame or eternal damnation.\r\n• Bring novel innovations to your culture and construct mighty castles and bastions to increase the wealth, prestige, and security of your realm. \r\n• The paths to follow are limitless: experience thousands of dynamic events and life-altering decisions tailored to each and every conceivable situation and character. There are countless ways of securing and keeping your place in the history books. \r\n\r\n"},"Affirmations":[],"MetaCriticPathName":"crusader-kings-iii","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25959.14065406176999862.d433bba3-dfb8-463a-bd60-0c7bd30829d8.8a527e59-eb28-4692-a0cf-f4be29c66f58","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5249031746427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":10962010112},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Shooter"],"MetacriticUrls":{"Xbox360":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/crysis-3"},"MetaScore":{"Xbox360":76},"ID":"9PNRHXZ6ZSS9","Title":{"en":"Crysis 3"},"Description":{"en":"The fate of the world is in your hands.

The undead have become Necromorphs; horrific zombie-alien hybrids that won't succumb to traditional means. Fortunately, your offense is equally unique, as the high-powered mining tools at your disposal provide the means to fight against the threat.\r\n\r\nGame Features:\r\n\r\nMessy monster slaying. The Necromorphs are unlike any enemies you've seen before. Headshots do about as much damage to them as flicking rubber bands. To survive, you'll need to dismember their insect-like limbs, one at a time.\r\n\r\nImprovised weapons. There aren't many traditional firearms aboard the Ishimura, but there's plenty of stopping power in Isaac's toolkit. Send horizontal or vertical blasts of energy at enemies with the Plasma Cutter, remotely control a high-speed sawblade with the Disc Ripper, and fill hallways with wide swaths of destruction with the Line Gun. Switch things up with alternate fire modes, and purchase upgrades to increase ammo, power, and reload speed.\r\n\r\nReal-time attacks. Whatever you do, don’t drop your guard. Everything takes place in real-time. That means any action you take, whether it be reloading or digging through your inventory, gives the Necromorphs a perfect opportunity to attack.

Its chilling environment was infested with disfigured creatures who spent the entire game roaming the hallways and coming up with new ways to kill. The head-removing, arm-slicing, blood-splattering action left gamers paralyzed with fear — and hungry for more. Now you can download Dead Space 2 to your PC and give yourself more reasons to sleep with both eyes open.\r\n\r\nIsaac Clarke’s story continues as he wakes from a coma in a city simply known as “The Sprawl.” Before he can get his bearings, the city is attacked by Necromorphs, the same creatures that made his life a bone-chilling hell the first time around. Confused, disoriented, and scared out of his mind, Isaac must battle the hideous creatures that have driven him insane.\r\n\r\nAlong with better weapons and more zero-gravity environments, Dead Space 2 takes away the silent protagonist and gives Isaac a voice, letting the player hear his reactions to horror that surrounds him. This adds a new level of despair to the game, as Isaac not only faces Necromorphs, but dementia, graphic visions of his deceased lover, and government persecution.

In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop.\r\n\r\nIF AT FIRST YOU DON’T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN \r\nEvery new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you’ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you’ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted.\r\n\r\nSINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER \r\nAre you the hero or the villain? You’ll experience DEATHLOOP’s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you’ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you’re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna’s stylish sneakers and invade another player’s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign.\r\n\r\nTHE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF – PARADISE OR PRISON    \r\nArkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself. While Blackreef may be a stylish wonderland, for Colt it is his prison, a world ruled by decadence where death has no meaning, and delinquents party forever while keeping him captive.

Set in Frank Herbert’s groundbreaking Dune universe, you must lead your faction and battle for control and dominance over the harsh desert planet of Arrakis.\r\n\r\nSpice is the most valuable resource in the universe. The spice extends life, expands consciousness, and makes interstellar travel possible. Found only on Arrakis, it is sought by the most influential forces in the universe. Play as one of several factions, including House Atreides, House Harkonnen, House Corrino, the Smugglers, and the native Fremen, and compete for power over Dune and the spice.\r\n\r\nScan the landscape for wormsign or risk losing your troops and spice harvesters to titanic sandworms who will burst through the dunes to swallow and devour them whole. Crush your opponents in combat, best them through political intrigue, and undermine them with your network of illusive spies.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank Herbert’s Dune\r\nExperience the unique Dune universe, one of the most influential sci-fi settings ever created. Lead your faction to victory with iconic characters, such as Duke Leto Atreides, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, Esmar Tuek, and Liet Kynes. Stay alert as opposing factions seek to gain the upper hand and the planet itself threatens with withering deserts, huge storms, and consuming sandworms.\r\n\r\nForge your own path to victory\r\nBalance open warfare, subterfuge, political influence, and economic supremacy to prevail and gain control over the most important planet in the universe! Use secretive agents to sabotage the plans of your opponents. Vote on political resolutions in the Landsraad to further your strategy.\r\n\r\n4X in real-time   \r\nExplore Dune with ornithopters to discover resources, villages, and points of interest. Expand with your troops to take control of more and more regions. Exploit the resources through buildings and spice harvesters to dominate the economy. Deploy your spaceships and aircrafts to exterminate your enemies but beware as outright aggression can have high political repercussions.\r\n\r\nChoose your faction\r\nTake the path of honor and political power as the respected House Atreides, or choose violence and devious plots as House Harkonnen. Become master of desert survival and guerilla tactics with the native Fremen and gain influence through shady deals and infiltration as the Smugglers, or eliminate any threats to your rule and assert your domination over the spice trade as the imperial House Corrino.\r\nTailor each faction’s existing strengths and weaknesses by selecting your councilors. With the Atreides’ legendary swordmaster Duncan Idaho at your side, expansion and combat prowess are improved. Gain power over people and information with the aid of Chani Kynes of the Fremen, or overwhelm with military might with Rabban of the Harkonnens. Increase your influence in the Imperium, by involving Corrino’s Princess Irulan in your plots.\r\n\r\nUp to 4-player Multiplayer\r\nBand together in 2v2 matches or face each other in a free-for-all of up to four players. Tailor the parameters of your multiplayer match to your preferences, including AI difficulty, map size, victory conditions, and the aggression of sandworms, storms, and Sietches.

Some nay-sayers have called the magnifying glass \"useless\", but what do they know? \r\n\r\nIn Case 1, The Haunted Island, a sloth has been haunted for weeks by a mysterious ghost that nobody can seem to track down. Even after hiring a team of ghost scientists, the mystery is no closer to being solved. Luckily for this tropical sloth, and unluckily for this pesky ghost, Frog Detective is here to crack the case! The Haunted Island is the first in this award-winning series, and this bite-sized mystery is what started an international cult obsession with the world of Frog Detective.\r\n\r\nIn the second mystery, The Case of the Invisible Wizard, we follow the Detective to Warlock Woods, where a celebratory parade for their newest neighbour has been maliciously destroyed. Now the neighbour is nowhere to be seen, and the town is in ruin. Can Frog Detective get to the bottom of things? We sure hope so, otherwise the game would be a bummer. \r\n\r\nIn the exciting series finale, Corruption at Cowboy County, The Detective and Lobster Cop are tasked to solve the conundrum of a sheriff-less town. But not all is as it seems here, when a surprisingly simple solution to the case reveals a sinister scheme. Maybe crime is real after all... \r\nThis final mystery is jam-packed with twists and turns, a true love letter to the Frog Detective fans.\r\n\r\nFrog Detective: The Entire Mystery is a family-friendly yet witty take on the detective game genre. Solve the mysteries on your own, or play along with friends as you take turns reading out the dialogue.

As the leader of possibly the last civilized society on Earth, you’re going to build the city your survivors live in, discover new technologies, explore frozen wastelands and most importantly, manage and rule society to prepare it for life in an unforgiving world. Whether you’re an enlightened ruler or an iron-fisted tyrant, you’ll discover choices in this world aren’t as easy as they seem, and that holding power over people has a cost as heavy as the responsibility you feel in caring for them.\r\n\r\nSHAPE YOUR SOCIETY\r\nEstablish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe. If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. \r\n\r\nShould you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Some of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless.\r\n\r\nEXPAND AND EXPLORE\r\nSurvival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills.\r\n\r\nWhile New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society’s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.\r\n"},"Affirmations":[],"MetaCriticPathName":"frostpunk","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60016.14372914980969275.d331a64f-b3f1-4a83-91cf-cb9cce9ce027.2a30409a-59be-488d-9ccb-822b8974b208","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5248287770427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":9621059778},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Role playing"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/fuga-melodies-of-steel"},"MetaScore":{"PC":84},"ID":"9NLX3GWW0HF1","Title":{"en":"Fuga: Melodies of Steel"},"Description":{"en":"\"We have to fight!

That’s a lot to shoulder for a grape barely off the vine… and more than a few inhabitants are skeptical they have what it takes. Fortunately, Concord has friends like Elderberry, Rana, and Fuji on their side! With their help, you can take on the dangerous Rot and find ways to encourage other residents to assist in the efforts.\r\n\r\nThe Grove is your home, and your work will affect change for the better!

Inspired by timeless classic ARPG's such as Diablo 2 and Titan Quest, Ghostlore features a detailed item and character customization system, procedurally generated maps, and authentic 90's retro graphics.\n\nLORE COMES TO LIFE\nThe bloodthirsty Penanggal is a gruesome creature with origins in Malay folklore. It comprises of nothing more than a disembodied head and dangling entrails. The Indonesian Babi Ngepet myth tells of sorcerors who sacrifice their humanity in order to become boar demons. The tales of Hungry Ghosts are superstitions brought over by Chinese immigrants - undead horrors cursed to remain forever hungry due to their greed in mortal life.\n\nStories from the maritime region of Southeast-Asia are full of all manner of nightmarish, horrifying creatures. Are you brave enough to face them? Discover over 40 different enemies, each with their quirks and tactics to defeat based on their descriptions in folklore.\n\nA WORLD LIKE NO OTHER\nExplore a procedurally generated world that takes inspiration from the developers' home country of Singapore, its two closest neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia, and the rest of Southeast Asia.\n\nPlayers unfamiliar with the region will get to experience a culture that is underrepresented and rarely seen in other forms of media. Players who live in Southeast Asia will find plenty of things they recognize - such as the food! Collect and prepare various meals to boost your stats. Don't fight on an empty stomach!\n\nMULTI CLASS SYSTEM\nGhostlore allows you to mix-and-match abilities from 3 out of 6 character classes to create your own unique hero. The 6 classes are:\n• The Adept: Mystic warriors skilled in Martial Arts, honing their mind as well as their body.\n• The Exorcist: Able to sense the spirit world with ESP and cast out evil spirits.\n• The Feral: Fearless fighters bestowed with the power of blood magic and the ability to transform into a Weretiger.\n• The Geomancer: Masters of the art of bending the elemental forces of Earth, Fire, Ice and Lightning to their will.\n• The Hashashin: Shadowy assassins who rely on speed and stealth to take down opponents.\n• The Sentinel: Keepers of the forest with the ability to communicate with animals.\n\nBUILD YOUR OWN SKILL TREES WITH THE SKILL LINK SYSTEM\nEach class comes with a “skill set”, a pool containing active skills, skill modifiers, and passive class bonuses. Skills must be assigned to a grid in order to be usable. More grid spaces unlock as you level up. Things can be placed in or taken out of the grid at will.\n\nSkill modifiers can be used to change the characteristics of any active skill from any class. Skill modifiers link together with active skills both across and down. (see green highlighted area in image). Some skill modifiers have tradeoffs.\n\nSome skill modifiers are trigger modifiers. Trigger modifiers allow a skill to be used automatically, as long as there is enough MP, the skill is not on cooldown, and the modifier’s specified conditions are met.\n\nCOMBO SKILLS\nEach active skill is also able to combine with skills from other classes to form an advanced skill that incorporates the characteristics of both base skills. Combo skills are created when two compatible skills are placed adjacent to one another in the skill grid.\n\nGLYPH SYSTEM\nThe Glyph system is where Ghostlore brings something truly new to the Action-RPG table. In your travels you will find Glyphs - magical symbols that you can inscribe onto your body to gain new powers.Each Glyph takes up space on your body (represented in game as a grid). As your level increases, so do the number of glyphs you can inscribe onto yourself.Here's where things get interesting: Compound glyphs are rare and special glyphs that use 5 normal glyph spaces, but grant additional bonuses to glyphs that are placed within their configuration. Plan your Compound Glyph layout in order to maximise stat bonuses!In Ghostlore, you can wield a variety of weapons prevalent in Southeast-Asian martial arts:• The Kris or Keris - a blade with a distinctively wavy shape. It is a well-balanced weapon.\n• The Bow and Arrow has been a staple of hunting since the dawn of time; apparently they come in handy with ghost-hunting as well!\n• Parangs, also known as machetes, are cleaving blades with a wide arc.\n• The deadly Kukri knives are the fastest attacking melee weapons in the game.\n• The trusty Spear has the longest reach out of all the melee weapons.\n• Finally, there are enchanted Talismans that can fly and give foes nasty papercuts.\n\nIn addition, you can find and equip a variety of Amulets. Amulets are commonly sold in many parts of real world Southeast Asia as good luck charms. In the world of Ghostlore, their power is very, very real. Equipping the right Amulet for the situation can mean the difference between a glorious victory and an untimely demise.Additionally, items can be modified in a couple of unique ways:\n\nSpirits inhabiting items are the reason why some of them have magical properties. Visit the Psychic to awaken the spirits which lay dormant in items such as weapons, shields, hats, scarves and amulets. Once awakened, the spirit will ask you to settle a score. Upon fulfilment of the request, your item will strengthen with new enchantments.Based on actual Southeast Asian folklore, the Orang Bunian are nature spirits that you can meet in your travels. On rare occasion, they will bless your items with new, random properties.\n\nNEVER FIGHT ALONE\n• Local co-op multiplier lets you play with up to 4 of your friends on the same screen.\n• Modding support allows you to customise your experience with mods from the community.\n• The Shrine of Balance is an optional asynchronous multiplayer feature which lets you help other players by sending them equipment. You have better chances of good loot in return when they use your equipment.\n• The Shrine of Spirits is another optional asynchronous online multiplayer mechanic where a 'snapshot' of another player's current character (also known as their 'Ghost Data') can be temporarily summoned into the your own game as an ally NPC.\n\nENDLESS CHALLENGES\nMission Mode: Undertake randomized missions after completing the campaign. Unlock Map Data, which allows you to modify missions and change the odds more to your favour.

You no longer have to fantasize about being a goat, your dreams have finally come true! \r\n\r\nGameplay-wise, Goat Simulator is all about causing as much destruction as you possibly can as a goat. It has been compared to an old-school skating game, except instead of being a skater, you're a goat, and instead of doing tricks, you wreck stuff. Destroy things with style, such as doing a backflip while headbutting a bucket through a window, and you'll earn even more points! When it comes to goats, not even the sky is the limit, as you can probably just bug through it and crash the game.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer\r\nGoat Simulator is a completely stupid game and, to be honest, you should probably spend your money on something else, such as a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a real goat.\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n• You can be a goat \r\n• Get points for wrecking stuff - brag to your friends that you're the alpha goat \r\n• MILLIONS OF BUGS! We're only eliminating the crash-bugs, everything else is hilarious and we're keeping it \r\n• In-game physics that bug out all the time \r\n• Seriously look at that goat's neck \r\n• You can be a goat"},"Affirmations":[],"MetaCriticPathName":"goat-simulator","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":0,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57187.13882037073203566.da1afb62-bb11-43df-b6aa-9b0deb8f35d9.9dc5c212-78c7-439e-abe0-53a972b77cda","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.647.13882037073203566.da1afb62-bb11-43df-b6aa-9b0deb8f35d9.ca86a65d-325a-4780-9a16-4ecd564b6591","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59785.13882037073203566.da1afb62-bb11-43df-b6aa-9b0deb8f35d9.6efa73fb-61ad-4dcd-aecc-d79e6bbb95fc","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37942.13882037073203566.da1afb62-bb11-43df-b6aa-9b0deb8f35d9.3ea5c2d6-19c6-4bf7-a77e-af0b970d27a0","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38783.13882037073203566.da1afb62-bb11-43df-b6aa-9b0deb8f35d9.49fc1cd9-00c5-48ad-ac00-b8bfddbb0134","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43618.13882037073203566.da1afb62-bb11-43df-b6aa-9b0deb8f35d9.61b7186b-8eb2-4add-be15-220759bcae09","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49933.13882037073203566.da1afb62-bb11-43df-b6aa-9b0deb8f35d9.67886b8f-dd57-47ef-8974-5a568a8f62e8","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18894.13882037073203566.da1afb62-bb11-43df-b6aa-9b0deb8f35d9.48926a7c-b68b-4c3e-9903-c1cc299b7d40","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17605.13882037073203566.da1afb62-bb11-43df-b6aa-9b0deb8f35d9.c3136ff0-40c8-418a-b69c-d779aef01419","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28595.13882037073203566.da1afb62-bb11-43df-b6aa-9b0deb8f35d9.b5a41848-3f93-49ad-814b-55e763322edd","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52810.13882037073203566.da1afb62-bb11-43df-b6aa-9b0deb8f35d9.fa24636a-6ec6-4d9e-81f5-cb242d2cd8c6"],"ReleaseDate":5248446242427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":1945789365},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Family & kids","Sports"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/golf-with-your-friends"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":68},"ID":"9MVK5W0HMRP7","Title":{"en":"Golf With Your Friends (Windows Version)"},"Description":{"en":"Why have friends if not to play Golf...

Embark on an ever-changing journey, build your own bestiary, defeat medieval superstars and collect perks to unleash special powers.\r\n\r\nBecome a master of the Living Ink, grab your quill and build your unique strategy time after time so that you can be named the greatest Inkulinati of all time!\r\n\r\nINKULINATI IS INSPIRED BY REAL-LIFE MEDIEVAL MARGINALIA\r\n700 years in the making, finally these bizarre art pieces can come alive in a video game and show that medieval people also had their “memes” and that they laughed from the same silly things that we do today. You’ll see sword-wielding rabbits, dogs with spears, trumpets lodged in bottoms, human-eating snails, and more. Much, much more…\r\n\r\nFIGHT LIKE AN INKULINATI\r\nInkulinati are a legendary group who battle one another on the pages of medieval manuscripts. They fight by drawing Beasts with the Living Ink. Thanks to this magical substance, those creatures come to life and an epic battle ensues.Move your Beasts across the battlefield, perform actions on or with them, make tactical use of obstacles and collect more Living Ink to draw new Beasts which allows you to gain an advantage over your opponent.\r\n\r\nMULTIPLE DEADLY (AND BIZARRE) BEASTS TO UNLOCK\r\nDonkeys playing trumpets with their bottoms, bishop cats vanquishing heretics with prayers, heavy but deadly snails that eat units alive, and more. Much, much more. They all have their special skills and are waiting for your command.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL, BATTLE TIDE-TURNING ACTIONS PERFORMED BY THE INKULINATI\r\nIt’s not just your Beasts that can cause havoc and damage. Use your fists to smash your opponent's units, draw obstacles to create barriers, relocate your units with a move of your finger, or explode your troops to create pure, pure chaos. Just remember - your opponent can do it too.\r\n\r\nADAPT YOUR TACTIC TO EVERY BATTLE\r\nEach Inkulinati has its own army, with different Beasts, who in turn, have different abilities, strengths, and unfortunately, weaknesses (or fortunately - depending which side you’re on). But it’s not just the armies that can influence who will win any given duel. Each Battlefield is its own domain, with its own particular dangers that you should watch out for, and opportunities that you can use. You will have to use your wits and adapt your strategy to beat the opposing Inkulinati’s army on each specific Battlefield.\r\n\r\nA SINGLE-PLAYER CAMPAIGN\r\nUncover the mystery and secrets of Inkulinati and face such opponents as Death, Dante Alighieri, and more. Go out into the world and start your adventure! Fight the biggest Inkulinati masters in the land, tame the untamed Beasts, build your ultimate army, try to bring back your Master from the clutches of death, and most importantly, finish your grand quest with the biggest party that the middle ages have ever seen! Howza!!!\r\n\r\nCREATE AND DEVELOP YOUR OWN CHARACTER\r\nAs any aspiring Inkulinati Master, you will get to create your own Tiny-Inkulinati. During your journey you will learn the secret techniques of drawing new Beasts and Inkulinati Hand Actions, allowing you to choose the composition of your army. You can be a brave knight that has no fear and will send his loyal troops straight at his opponents. Or perhaps you would like to play with a bit more tact? In that case, you can be a nun who with the power of prayer can confuse her enemies and heal thy own servants. Those styles, and more, are waiting to be discovered and made your own.

All-Star Battle Mode also offers special cosmetic skins for characters and unique illustrations that can be enjoyed in gallery mode.\r\n\r\n• How the game has evolved from the original All-Star Battle\r\nBased on the All-Star Battle system released in 2014, the game design of JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle R reinvigorates the experience with adjustments to the fighting tempo and the addition of hit stops and jump dashes. With new audio recordings from the Part 6 anime voice actors, the full atmosphere of the animated series is realized. Both fans who have played the original All-Star Battle and newcomers will be able to enjoy the experience."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"jojos-bizarre-adventure-all-star-battle-r","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58329.14593718710691656.80a2a131-a8cc-43cc-b6da-b0d5958123e1.1ff0b563-a05b-4352-b4ba-db98c7c95cd2","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48789.14593718710691656.80a2a131-a8cc-43cc-b6da-b0d5958123e1.b688a163-8582-42e3-b94c-3cb02a84e40f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19498.14593718710691656.80a2a131-a8cc-43cc-b6da-b0d5958123e1.a7ed0873-16b4-44f4-9244-8226072d4676","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56648.14593718710691656.80a2a131-a8cc-43cc-b6da-b0d5958123e1.9c4b3113-bd38-4697-a668-7cd5af0a8f39","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40217.14593718710691656.80a2a131-a8cc-43cc-b6da-b0d5958123e1.6bfa311c-4172-4921-a60b-44b7d4b941a9","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41180.14593718710691656.80a2a131-a8cc-43cc-b6da-b0d5958123e1.8f46dd47-95ef-4b93-b90b-35d0f244bace"],"ReleaseDate":5249662754427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":5513699328},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Simulation","Strategy"],"MetacriticUrls":{},"MetaScore":{},"ID":"9MWHMJ0SRBXV","Title":{"en":"Jurassic World Evolution 2"},"Description":{"en":"Jurassic World Evolution 2 is the much-anticipated sequel to Frontier’s ground-breaking 2018 management simulation, Jurassic World Evolution, offering an all new narrative campaign voiced by cast members from across the Jurassic World film franchise, exciting new features, four engaging game modes, and an expanded roster of awe-inspiring dinosaurs.   \r\n\r\nAn Original Jurassic World Story \r\n\r\nLearn what it takes to be a park management master in Campaign mode, a compelling, original narrative that puts you at the heart of the action following the earth-shattering events of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.

It may or may not change over time or release as a final product. Purchase only if you are comfortable with the current state of the unfinished game.\r\n\r\nPhantom Abyss is a massive asynchronous multiplayer game that casts players into procedurally-generated temples and tasks them with retrieving the sacred relics hidden within deadly chambers. Intrepid adventurers will dodge scores of hidden traps, leap treacherous chasms, and flee relentless guardians through branching paths until one of the relics are claimed or the devices of death overwhelm them. Be warned, you only get one attempt at each temple and failure or settling for a lesser relic means you will never see that temple again...\r\n\r\nThe cleverest players will use the phantom runs of failed attempts from other players to their advantage and avoid the missteps and mistakes that led to their doom. Once the legendary relic at the bottom of each temple is found, the temple goes away forever and becomes the priceless trophy of the skilled adventurer.\r\n\r\nAsynchronous Multiplayer\r\nExplore the perilous halls and colossal rooms of each temple alongside the phantoms of fallen players that came before you. Use their successes and failures to your advantage to progress deeper than they ever could have hoped.\r\n\r\nUnlock More Treacherous Floors\r\nRecover keys from chests to unlock deeper, deadlier sections of the temple that house more coveted relics. The more difficult a relic is to obtain, the greater the reward - the final Legendary Relic of a temple allows you to claim the whole temple so that it's gone forever.\r\n\r\nBlessings from the Gods\r\nAs adventurers venture further into a temple, offerings of collected treasures can be made at altars to gain a new blessing for the rest of the run. Collect as much treasure as you can to please the gods and gain a double jump, glide jump, extended slide, damage protection, and more!\r\n\r\nUnlockable Whips\r\nUnlock new whips with success and choose from your collection before venturing into your next run. Each whips carries a minor blessing but also a curse that may complicate your attempt at riches and glory.\r\n\r\nFull details on the latest status of the game, how you can give feedback and report issues can be found at https://www.phantomabyss.com/"},"Affirmations":[],"MetaCriticPathName":"phantom-abyss-game-preview","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56545.13633827486627594.07290a41-f96f-4e82-b3f2-145174a6351a.d48b6ff1-9c9a-4e1a-9a03-7c59d51483fb","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":false,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":false,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5249704226427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":2574901248},"MetacriticPlatform":null,"AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Classics","Role playing","Simulation","Strategy"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/phoenix-point"},"MetaScore":{"PC":74},"ID":"9P1P5Q3BNM7J","Title":{"en":"Phoenix Point"},"Description":{"en":"Phoenix Point puts players in the midst of a desperate fight to take back the Earth from a mutating, alien menace.

It's up to you to save the planet and rebuild civilization, but there may be much more to the alien threat than meets the eye.\r\n\r\n* Mutating Alien Menace: Face down an ever-changing alien threat that adapts to your tactics and offers no respite even as your team becomes more powerful and technologically advanced.\r\n\r\n* Uncover the Secrets of the Pandoravirus: Phoenix Point features a complex narrative, with multiple endings that the player can only uncover via multiple playthroughs. Discover a secret history, as you learn about the origins of the mutants, the Pandoravirus, and Phoenix Point itself through exploration, diplomacy, and research.\r\n\r\n* Manage Diplomatic Relations: The Phoenix Project is not the only organization trying to reclaim the Earth. The militaristic New Jericho, the mystical Disciples of Anu, and the technophiles of Synedrion all offer unique rewards for co-operation and threats for opposition. It is up to you to decide how, or even if, to deal with them.\r\n\r\n* Take Aim on the Battlefield: In addition to equipping and commanding units, Phoenix Point lets you take direct control of your soldier's shots in combat, with a unique free-aiming system. Target enemy weakspots, weapons, or valuables, or just go for center mass.\r\n\r\n* Next-Gen Tech with Classic Pedigree: Phoenix Point was designed by Julian Gollop, the creator of the X-COM series in the 1990s. Keeping the core ethos of X-COM while updating the visuals, technology, and systems to modern standards has made Phoenix Point best-in-class."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"phoenix-point","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23750.14507726714197033.ea391b48-d8cb-4724-a6cb-765168bd5161.0029c50b-c234-475e-9928-0185fc83e0aa","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27297.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.8f0d79d4-fb71-4169-bb64-0b77cac69f7f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3522.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.17680a69-6b0d-4293-a53c-6d16fe0035fd","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39128.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.c1af4919-7997-458a-ae19-4b9cf83ecfaa","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63541.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.c3d3f2f0-5855-4872-bbdd-720b19605e27","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34869.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.dd0e9d28-4298-463e-98c1-032a9fa45f9c"],"ReleaseDate":5248809122427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":25358311424},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Platformer"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/pikuniku"},"MetaScore":{"PC":74},"ID":"9N8QNKN5ZKTH","Title":{"en":"Pikuniku"},"Description":{"en":"Pikuniku is an absurdly wonderful puzzle-exploration game that takes place in a strange but playful world where not everything is as happy as it seems.

The unsettling environment is a character itself.\r\n\r\nEvery location contains its own theme (story), puzzles and characters that are integral in creating a cohesive world.

But keep your eyes open - the game won’t show you any sympathy if you miss something important on your uneasy travels.\r\n\r\nFull body awareness\r\nPlayers will experience better immersion being aware of the character’s body and movement.

Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall.\r\n\r\nIt’s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge’s reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the “Flux State” controls the city of Berlin. It’s a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, there’s no better place to earn a quick payday.\r\n\r\nNow, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return…\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\nA Classic, Story-Driven cRPG: Dragonfall hearkens back to the golden age of computer RPG’s with a novel-like branching narrative full of sharp prose and deep character development.

Fight your way across the most immersive maps yet, with many real-world locations captured in stunning detail, and an improved traversal system that lets you explore more of them than ever before.\r\nFrance, 1944 – As part of a covert US Rangers operation to weaken the Atlantikwall fortifications along the coast of Brittany, elite marksman Karl Fairburne makes contact with the French Resistance. Soon they uncover a secret Nazi project that threatens to end the war before the Allies can even invade Europe: Operation Kraken.\r\n\r\nEXPANSIVE CAMPAIGN\r\nMany real-world locations have been captured using photogrammetry to recreate a living, immersive environment, and multiple infiltration and extraction points and kill list targets provide a whole new perspective on each mission. Take on the Nazi plot solo or work with a partner, with improved co-op mechanics allowing you to share ammo and items, give orders and heal each other.\r\n\r\nADVANCED GUNPLAY PHYSICS AND TRAVERSAL\r\nUse ziplines, slide down slopes and shimmy along ledges to reach the perfect vantage point, or to sneak past a sharp-eyed lookout. Factor in rifle stock and barrel options along with gravity, wind and heart rate while you line up your sights on the target.\r\n\r\nHIGH CALIBRE CUSTOMISATION\r\nUse workbenches to customise and upgrade virtually every aspect of your weapon – change scopes, stocks, barrels, magazines and more. Rifles, secondaries and pistols all have a huge variety of options. On top of that you can select the ammo to suit your target, from armour-piercing right down to non-lethal.\r\n\r\nINVASION MODE – CAMPAIGN DROP IN PvP AND CO-OP\r\nInvade another player’s Campaign as an Axis sniper and engage in a deadly game of cat and mouse, providing a new dimension to the challenge as you stalk your prey. Alternatively, as Karl you can call for assistance and have a second sniper drop in to help you out of a tricky situation.\r\n\r\nTENSE ADVERSIAL MULTIPLAYER\r\nCustomise your character and loadout and earn XP, medals and ribbons as you take on intensely competitive 16 player battles that will really test your sharpshooting skills. If co-op’s more your style, you can team up with up to 3 other players against waves of enemies in Survival mode.\r\n\r\nENHANCED KILL CAM\r\nMore realistic and grisly than ever, the trademark X-ray kill cam returns, showing you the true destructive power of each shot. Bones deflect bullets unpredictably, ripping a new path through enemy bodies. SMGs and pistols can also trigger kill cams, including multiple shots in dramatic slow motion.\r\n"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"sniper-elite-5","OriginalPlatforms":[5],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34732.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.d7d5968f-4e09-4b2b-aea5-ea36b059cec1","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6211.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.933990f6-2efb-402c-b356-0a6256808dc6","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44790.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.d343893e-b214-4c48-a6ec-9e91c5857981","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2551.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.72068546-cd69-44e2-bd9e-06597bf3156b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40463.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.b46a49fc-a3e6-461e-bef9-19716df95233","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39524.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.1d7a605d-51ad-4988-809f-e37986e430d0","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22655.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.72fff174-717c-4b40-8672-d8c553e93ab9","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51794.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.9449b6b4-d011-462b-a8a8-cd04cf890bee","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18234.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.918d17fd-7f13-4e22-858c-51a6a3217f45","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26546.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.d30a9588-c4f9-4220-9c10-89f2dab0241c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33660.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.f7433785-db79-48fb-aa7c-980c845f240d"],"ReleaseDate":5249577218427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":112653893632},"MetacriticPlatform":"xbox-series-x","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Simulation"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/snowrunner"},"MetaScore":{"PC":82},"ID":"9NP6WL1XQDBW","Title":{"en":"SnowRunner (Windows 10)"},"Description":{"en":"Get ready for the next-generation off-road experience! \r\n\r\nSnowRunner puts you in the driver’s seat of powerful vehicles as you conquer extreme open environments with the most advanced terrain simulation ever.

Roll for initiative, take attacks of opportunity, manage player location and the verticality of the battle field. Set yourself up for the finishing strike and possibly roll a natural 20 at that key moment of battle.​\r\n\r\nIn Solasta, you take control of four heroes, each with unique skills that complement one another. Every hero expresses themselves in the adventure, making each action and dialog choice a dynamic part to the story. Players will create their heroes just as they would in a pen-and-paper game by choosing their race, class, personality and rolling for their stats.​\r\n\r\nYou make the choices, dice decide your destiny.\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nKey Features:\r\n\r\nAn Epic Team Adventure\r\n- Discover the shattered world of Solasta: explore ruins and dungeons for legendary treasures, learn the truth of an age-old cataclysm - and stop it from happening again. \r\n- Create your very own party of adventurers with our Character Creation Tool in the classic tabletop RPG tradition. Breathe life into your heroes, and see their personalities reflected in their dialogue. Tailor your squad to your preferred strategy and maximize your party's abilities. The choice is yours.\r\n\r\nDiscover a Mysterious & Dynamic World\r\n- Delve into long forgotten dungeons to unearth ancient artifacts, but stay watchful of light and darkness: many dangers hide in the dark, but a light can attract monsters. Some enemies have darkvision, some may flee from your torch... Successful adventurers will learn to use it to their advantage. \r\n- Fight monsters in squad-level, turn-based, tactical combat. Solasta's dynamic environment offers some interesting tactical options. Bridges can collapse, leaving enemies stranded and vulnerable. Walls and columns can be pushed over - on top of your foes, if you do it right. The world is your playground.\r\n\r\nPrepare to Think in Three Dimensions\r\n- The dungeons in Solasta are more than flat game-boards. Climb, jump, or fly around obstacles. Evade or surprise foes from above or below. Push them into chasms or drop things on their heads. Position yourself on high grounds to start the fight with an advantage. \r\n- Size also matters. Escape through narrow passages where bigger enemies won't fit and crawl through tunnels to find secret areas. Take advantage of the environment to find cover suited to your own size. Watch out, though - the monsters are also thinking vertically.\r\n\r\nDungeon Maker\r\n- In Solasta, the adventure does not stop after the campaign is over. Unleash your creativity and craft your own dungeons to play using the in-game Dungeon Maker! From the room layout, monster composition and treasure the party will find – down to the decoration and lighting of each room or the music track playing – everything is decided by you.\r\n- Note that the Dungeon Maker is a work in progress and will keep being improved as time goes by, so look forward to more Dungeon Maker features in the future!"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"solasta-crown-of-the-magister","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55762.13899562469464238.c1646c67-46ab-4599-8b51-491c5f064ca0.65fd3add-aefa-4bfe-aab6-067fbeb384ad","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5249263334427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":13576654848},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/soma"},"MetaScore":{"PC":84},"ID":"C23M2TC1ZFPJ","Title":{"en":"SOMA"},"Description":{"en":"The radio is dead, food is running out, and the machines have started to think they are people.

The world has expanded in other ways, too, with branching paths and multi-layered levels adding a third dimension to the classic 2d platforming gameplay."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"spelunky-2","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36144.14298096177274930.caec21fb-7c68-4a6c-b169-f9b7429b0fcd.133c67f9-65b1-4add-9996-4b2917117126","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18411.14298096177274930.caec21fb-7c68-4a6c-b169-f9b7429b0fcd.8b1cabbf-29cd-406c-bd80-3e2afb5b94bd","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26455.14298096177274930.caec21fb-7c68-4a6c-b169-f9b7429b0fcd.4294293b-6443-45aa-8501-e442fdd0f5f0","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38802.14298096177274930.caec21fb-7c68-4a6c-b169-f9b7429b0fcd.5b69e45b-1fea-4985-b88c-7951aa823d90","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52992.14298096177274930.caec21fb-7c68-4a6c-b169-f9b7429b0fcd.075c7069-b3f9-4145-b0e2-801f3af4b3ad","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18411.14298096177274930.caec21fb-7c68-4a6c-b169-f9b7429b0fcd.8b1cabbf-29cd-406c-bd80-3e2afb5b94bd","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36855.14298096177274930.caec21fb-7c68-4a6c-b169-f9b7429b0fcd.8b42d60d-31d3-4022-88a3-fb46d22bfb40","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59433.14298096177274930.caec21fb-7c68-4a6c-b169-f9b7429b0fcd.3c033692-e292-4524-a587-40f313a5f0e5","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41427.14298096177274930.caec21fb-7c68-4a6c-b169-f9b7429b0fcd.260afe72-cbf9-414e-b8e6-17b91c42db1c"],"ReleaseDate":5249462306427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":674836480},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure","Other","Platformer"],"MetacriticUrls":{},"MetaScore":{},"ID":"9N0TRF57SMQH","Title":{"en":"SpiderHeck"},"Description":{"en":"Spiders With Laser Swords!\r\n\r\nSpiderHeck is a fast-paced couch co-op brawler where spiders dance to the death in the grip of chaotic battles using laser swords, grenades and even rocket launchers to defeat their foes.\r\n\r\nChallenge yourself by fighting wave after wave of vicious enemies in endless hours of single-player fun, or let the mayhem begin in a dazzling fight against your friends taking on the enemies in PvE; stab, sling, and scramble your way to victory in this silly spider showdown."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"spiderheck","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19160.13918689285493336.0819ed4c-c94e-42c7-bd95-af9916211f52.f0608ff7-aa51-48de-9261-b4668ef7a641","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50284.13918689285493336.a3d180ee-1eb8-4947-b73a-b708bf633596.549b9180-298b-44ae-b088-5523d9506c30","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52534.13918689285493336.a3d180ee-1eb8-4947-b73a-b708bf633596.afb0e345-6b05-41b8-9093-1251c5f6b07c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63647.13918689285493336.a3d180ee-1eb8-4947-b73a-b708bf633596.11c2828f-ef16-4075-a802-f545534100bf","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41128.13918689285493336.a3d180ee-1eb8-4947-b73a-b708bf633596.bdb2868e-3cd2-4d4b-b1d5-495c2ca91291","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60685.13918689285493336.a3d180ee-1eb8-4947-b73a-b708bf633596.aeed1bf3-0770-46bc-98dc-281cbd1a1d73","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43847.13918689285493336.a3d180ee-1eb8-4947-b73a-b708bf633596.987263c4-85e8-4534-9f3f-caaee5f423c3","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15063.13918689285493336.a3d180ee-1eb8-4947-b73a-b708bf633596.73f42515-d9c7-4e1f-981e-1fb796ccb089","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35813.13918689285493336.a3d180ee-1eb8-4947-b73a-b708bf633596.5b716ef3-80e4-4708-a275-517935d1933f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42463.13918689285493336.a3d180ee-1eb8-4947-b73a-b708bf633596.4aab8521-9fd9-4204-8855-31fc647aeb84","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59650.13918689285493336.a3d180ee-1eb8-4947-b73a-b708bf633596.1d878e87-96f3-4942-9a19-79246ab84a18"],"ReleaseDate":5249680610427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":1512235008},"MetacriticPlatform":null,"AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Simulation"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/spore"},"MetaScore":{"PC":84},"ID":"9P6ZKL905TMT","Title":{"en":"SPORE™"},"Description":{"en":"Be the architect of your own universe with Spore, an exciting single-player adventure available for download to your PC.

This narratively-driven single player game puts you in the role of a Jedi Padawan who narrowly escaped the purge of Order 66 following the events of Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith. On a quest to rebuild the Jedi Order, you must pick up the pieces of your shattered past to complete your training, develop new powerful Force abilities, and master the art of the iconic lightsaber - all while staying one step ahead of the Empire and its deadly Inquisitors. \r\n\r\nWhile mastering your abilities, players will engage in cinematically-charged lightsaber and Force combat designed to deliver the kind of intense STAR WARS lightsaber battles as seen in the films. Players will need to approach enemies strategically, sizing up strengths and weaknesses while cleverly utilizing your Jedi training to overcome your opponents and solve the mysteries that lay in your path. \r\n\r\nSTAR WARS fans will recognize iconic locations, weapons, gear, and enemies while also meeting a roster of fresh characters, locations, creatures, droids and adversaries new to STAR WARS. As part of this authentic STAR WARS story, fans will delve into a galaxy recently seized by the Empire.

This combat system is intuitive to pick up, but takes training and practice to fully master its nuances as you gain new powers and abilities along your adventure.\r\n\r\n● A New Jedi Story Begins - As a former Padawan on the run from the Empire, you must complete your training before Imperial Inquisitors discover your plan to revive the Jedi Order. Aided by a former Jedi Knight, a cantankerous pilot, and a fearless droid, you must escape the evil machinations of the Empire in a story-driven adventure. Explore and overcome a wide range of challenges focused on combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving. \r\n\r\n● The Galaxy Awaits - Ancient forests, windswept rock faces, and haunted jungles are all unique biomes you’ll explore in Jedi: Fallen Order, with the freedom to decide when and where you go next. As you unlock new powers and abilities, opportunities open up to re-traverse maps in new ways; leveraging the Force to augment the way you explore.
