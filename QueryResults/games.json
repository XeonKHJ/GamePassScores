Design, build, and manage the city of your dreams, from public services to civic policies, and challenge yourself to grow from a simple town to a bustling metropolitan hub.\r\nCities: Skylines is an award-winning, best-selling management game, now available for the Xbox One with all of its robust city-simulation gameplay and unique charm along for the ride. The Xbox One Edition includes the base game and the popular After Dark expansion, allowing players to plan and design for their cities’ nightlife and tourist attractions.\r\n\r\nMain Features:\r\nBuild the city of your dreams: Plan road networks, bus lines and parks. Bring on a smog-filled industrial revolution or create a quiet beach town ideal for tourists powered by renewable energy. Bring education, healthcare and safety to your citizens. Build it your way!\r\n\r\nMulti-tiered and challenging simulation: Playing as the mayor of your city, you’ll be faced with balancing essential requirements such as education, water electricity, police, firefighting, healthcare and much more, along with your city’s economy. Citizens within your city react fluidly, keeping you on your toes with ever-evolving demands.\r\n\r\nExtensive local traffic simulation: Managing traffic and the needs of your citizens to work and play will require the use of several interactive transport systems – use careful road planning alongside buses, trains, subways, and much more.\r\n\r\nDistricts and policies: Be more than just another city hall official! Create a car-free downtown area, assign free public transport to your waterfront, or ban pets in suburbia. Designate parts of your city as a district in order to set policy at the local level, and give different parts of town their own personalities.\r\n\r\nAfter Dark included: Watch your city become an entirely different place at night: a day-night cycle will have your citizens seeking out places to unwind after work. Add in new policies and zones to create popular hotspots and provide enough taxis and trains to get to and from the clubs!"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"cities-skylines---xbox-one-edition","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7220.66617542682682743.811213f2-2c45-4145-973d-fe3e3774b196.96b48a30-7ed1-4bc9-8f8b-b114375b2e1c","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50626.66617542682682743.811213f2-2c45-4145-973d-fe3e3774b196.a6d917ae-9d3e-4f81-befd-5e2f400b6da2","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5870.66617542682682743.811213f2-2c45-4145-973d-fe3e3774b196.bdf7a32b-5324-4bef-b3ad-1dbb01518eeb","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56153.66617542682682743.811213f2-2c45-4145-973d-fe3e3774b196.4021f9c9-ae83-4577-8168-beb8405598cc","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9933.66617542682682743.811213f2-2c45-4145-973d-fe3e3774b196.f945ecda-3747-4427-a535-febbd40f8f61"],"ReleaseDate":5247969314427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":7348486144}},{"Categories":["Action & adventure","Platformer"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/clustertruck/"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":69},"ID":"BX4J85JZNGXQ","Title":{"en":"ClusterTruck"},"Description":{"en":"ClusterTruck is a new kind of platformer on-top of a speeding highway!  \nUse agility and acrobatics through insane levels in a game of \"the floor is lava\" on top of unpredictable, speeding trucks!\nThe game only gets harder when dangers such as swinging hammers, lasers and flamethrowers are added!   \n\nUnlock new abilities like the Grappling Hook, Truck Cannon and Time-Control!"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"clustertruck","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8813.63460736466173537.43accb13-0658-4cb9-a3a9-2dd4b18ae15e.31bec0ff-ab11-4731-bd2b-8bb28fab7c53","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61009.63460736466173537.43accb13-0658-4cb9-a3a9-2dd4b18ae15e.10703f97-7486-4d8d-8c2a-ae4be5bf52a2","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40883.63460736466173537.43accb13-0658-4cb9-a3a9-2dd4b18ae15e.bc33425a-5f6a-4817-8310-c7a96c86ac94","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18338.63460736466173537.43accb13-0658-4cb9-a3a9-2dd4b18ae15e.87eb0a5c-cd08-492a-a13a-cff9ab6414f9","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42272.63460736466173537.43accb13-0658-4cb9-a3a9-2dd4b18ae15e.5fcbdcf3-d6b6-4952-a9e7-b91f02870f97","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11334.63460736466173537.43accb13-0658-4cb9-a3a9-2dd4b18ae15e.677ab80c-ad99-44a3-9305-3378ad937b93","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50509.63460736466173537.43accb13-0658-4cb9-a3a9-2dd4b18ae15e.40e05844-aec2-4e58-9ca6-7cb0858f20d9","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47041.63460736466173537.43accb13-0658-4cb9-a3a9-2dd4b18ae15e.48153574-11ba-49a8-ac85-3540e74129f1","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51638.63460736466173537.43accb13-0658-4cb9-a3a9-2dd4b18ae15e.625ebdb7-845e-47d6-b7f5-5fbd3834e34f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5707.63460736466173537.43accb13-0658-4cb9-a3a9-2dd4b18ae15e.16c61651-8ec3-413e-831c-bbbe015bb036","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18002.63460736466173537.43accb13-0658-4cb9-a3a9-2dd4b18ae15e.744a0a0d-987f-4a5f-83f2-bff4a686207b"],"ReleaseDate":5247818114427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":495243264}},{"Categories":["Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/costume-quest-2/"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":65},"ID":"BZ92FB6PWXFJ","Title":{"en-us":"Costume Quest 2"},"Description":{"en-us":"Trick, treat and pick a fight with villainous dental soldiers in Costume Quest 2, the sweet sequel to Double Fine’s hit original, Costume Quest, that turned fans of all ages into candy obsessed crusaders.

War and Strife must hunt down these masters, gather information, and ultimately fight their way through a tangled, demonic conspiracy that threatens to forever upset the Balance and unravel all of creation."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"darksiders-genesis","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37795.69448640791975811.c544d438-5a2e-4e68-96d0-33f88c057181.02c8293d-bc94-4b40-9e98-09ce54590ed7","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50177.69448640791975811.c544d438-5a2e-4e68-96d0-33f88c057181.aa7d6206-effd-4704-add9-56afe5f28f27","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39729.69448640791975811.c544d438-5a2e-4e68-96d0-33f88c057181.8c83e860-f900-4936-99a8-46bd307ebda1","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40124.69448640791975811.c544d438-5a2e-4e68-96d0-33f88c057181.fe849c8f-2456-4d53-82a6-db76089e25f8","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54625.69448640791975811.c544d438-5a2e-4e68-96d0-33f88c057181.362baa91-a2fc-49fa-9062-9aa67cd45b74","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58048.69448640791975811.c544d438-5a2e-4e68-96d0-33f88c057181.8b3e5d72-f8b2-42ad-9ade-0479dd0d1535"],"ReleaseDate":5248858982427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":12446130176}},{"Categories":["Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/day-of-the-tentacle-remastered/"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":86},"ID":"9NKK6CX54183","Title":{"en":"Day of the Tentacle Remastered"},"Description":{"en":"Originally released by LucasArts in 1993 as a sequel to Ron Gilbert’s ground breaking Maniac Mansion, Day of the Tentacle is a mind-bending, time travel, cartoon puzzle adventure game in which three unlikely friends work together to prevent an evil mutated purple tentacle from taking over the world!\r\n\r\nOver twenty years later, Day of the Tentacle is back in a remastered edition that features all new hand-drawn, high resolution artwork, with remastered audio, music and sound effects.\r\n\r\nVoice only available in English and German.\r\n\r\n英語版　※日本語字幕には対応しておりません。"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"day-of-the-tentacle-remastered","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45089.13659998887820416.ac97c487-e49c-4236-a48f-681c4095040e.9f593142-562b-48e6-9ab5-20ea48887200","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16116.13659998887820416.ac97c487-e49c-4236-a48f-681c4095040e.29812dee-d828-48b2-ad4b-195e7f3a907a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61516.13659998887820416.ac97c487-e49c-4236-a48f-681c4095040e.ca82cbf0-3ae7-4d83-8407-b92dae95d1c4","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7277.13659998887820416.ac97c487-e49c-4236-a48f-681c4095040e.bad1227c-9422-468d-a72f-deac562db31a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24188.13659998887820416.ac97c487-e49c-4236-a48f-681c4095040e.d933a8ea-32d0-411f-bc5c-b3972f2d785e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3692.13659998887820416.ac97c487-e49c-4236-a48f-681c4095040e.09f6d88a-0ac2-4e21-850f-25e0485681b2","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55891.13659998887820416.ac97c487-e49c-4236-a48f-681c4095040e.b9eeb56e-328f-44e7-acb9-a5e2eedb8dcd","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61226.13659998887820416.ac97c487-e49c-4236-a48f-681c4095040e.f50cb273-4cd9-4540-9fed-a5d51a52dcb0"],"ReleaseDate":5249081894427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":2868015104}},{"Categories":["Action & adventure","Role playing","Shooter"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/dayz/"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":56},"ID":"BSR9NLHVF1KL","Title":{"en":"DayZ"},"Description":{"en":"\"DayZ is a hardcore open-world survival game with only one rule: stay alive, no matter what.

Tough but fair combat, responsive controls, challenging foes, permadeath and of course, the emergency panic roll to get you out of trouble, make for a demanding, visceral and cathartic action game. \r\n\r\nExperience a Roguevania, mixing an interconnected world, branching paths and unlockable skills with the constant adrenaline-pumping threat of permadeath.  No checkpoints. You either vanquish the final boss in one go, or you try again. However, you keep some of your progress for successive runs; new paths you’ve unlocked, access to new levels, mutations, abilities and weapons.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of weapons, Dead Cells features a plethora of ways to slay your enemies. A large variety of swords, bows and of course spells, but also whips, grenades and turrets, each one with its own unique twist. Plus, mutations and scrolls allow you to build and customize your character differently with each and every run.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day though, it’s YOUR skills as a player that matter most! Roguelites are about constantly sharpening your skills, until what was an insurmountable obstacle becomes a walk in the park. Patience, you’ll get better!… eventually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\nRogueVania: The progressive exploration of an interconnected world, with the replayability of a rogue-lite and the adrenaline pumping threat of permadeath.\r\n\r\n2D Souls-lite Action: Tough but fair combat, the iconic dodge roll, more than 90 weapons and spells with unique gameplay… The unforgiving action wed to the absence of any kind of safety net makes for an adrenalin pumping ride each and every run. \r\n\r\nNonlinear progression: Sewers, Ossuary or Ramparts?

Astroneer is set during the 25th century Intergalactic Age of Discovery, where Astroneers explore the frontiers of outer space, risking their lives in harsh environments to unearth rare discoveries and unlock the mysteries of the universe.\r\n\r\nOn this adventure, players can work together to build custom bases above or below ground, create vehicles to explore a vast solar system, and use terrain to create anything they can imagine. A player’s creativity and ingenuity are the key to seeking out and thriving while on exciting planetary adventures! In Astroneer you can:\r\n\r\n•Reshape the ground under your feet as though it were made of clay.\r\n•Survive on and explore carefully crafted planets that can be entirely deformed and traversed.\r\n•Snap together components and objects to build bases and vehicles.\r\n•Play with friends in 4 player online drop-in/drop-out co-op.\r\n•Discover and uncover the mysteries of the solar system\r\n\r\n•••Deform & shape everything around you•••\r\nIn Astroneer, players use their deform tool to dig, collect, shape and build anything they wish. Use this ability to dig to the center of the planet, build a ramp into the sky, or make megaliths just by using terrain! \r\n\r\n•••Explore an entire solar system•••\r\nOur vast solar system includes 7 wondrous planets that players can travel between and explore every inch of, from the entire spherical surface, through treacherous layers of caves, all the way down to mysterious the core. Each of those planets has unique and challenging surface and cave biomes that offer a multitude of challenges for players on their journey.\r\n\r\n•••Customize & build on the fly••• \r\nItems that Astroneers craft and find in the world can be snapped and connected together to create unique creations for any situation. Customize and decorate your bases, vehicles, and Astroneer.\r\n\r\n•••4 Player co-op•••\r\nAstroneer is better with friends. Group up with other players and work together to create massive industrial bases or to create fun games in the extensive creative sandbox. \r\n\r\n•••Survive & harness the power of the planets•••\r\nOnce Astroneers are ready, they may choose to attempt to understand and possibly harness the power behind mysterious structures found in the world.\r\n\r\nAstroneer began as a Game Preview title and would not be here today if not for your support, feedback, and ideas throughout that process. Now that we have hit 1.0 we will keep our pledge to continue building on the foundation that is Astroneer with free, ongoing content updates.

They’re hungry, thirsty, and need a place to sleep. They can - quite literally - die of boredom. It’s on you to save them. Build gardens to provide them with food, wells for water, and yoga balls and puppet shows to keep them entertained. You can even craft treadmills and solar panels to generate power for Tesla coils, electric fences, and other fortifications.\r\n\r\nYou’ll need robust defenses, as you’ll quickly see that The Drakes aren’t the only residents of The Hollow. The Feral have overrun the land, evil creatures that are looking to shred anything happy or good. Battle them one-on-one with a wide array of weapons ranging from tennis rackets to nail guns, bring your friends to lend a hand, and build your defenses so you can take them out without lifting a finger.\r\n\r\nTravel from region to region, season to season, taking the Drakes and their village with you.

The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\r\n\r\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully.

Use it to separate, scare and confuse intruders.\r\n- Use your gadgets to get advantage over the kids' team.\r\n- Gain trust amongst your foes and attack in the right moment.\r\n- Protect your basement!"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"secret-neighbor","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39468.14605254180386304.5d252ac0-3fdd-4a81-8d96-ade267e2d3a0.0ef6ecac-720d-4641-a0c4-3b42db7152b2","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36.14605254180386304.9afe751b-c9ed-4f41-a539-bea6839f9137.ca434557-f1e9-426a-a482-a410e8b4f3f6","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34601.14605254180386304.9afe751b-c9ed-4f41-a539-bea6839f9137.f8f19ee0-86b9-41bb-b423-bed92461bfce","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32306.14605254180386304.9afe751b-c9ed-4f41-a539-bea6839f9137.7501ad7e-759f-4660-bd08-814605d0d018","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14284.14605254180386304.9afe751b-c9ed-4f41-a539-bea6839f9137.3ad73751-d78c-49f8-8652-fd16f9f77562","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12526.14605254180386304.9afe751b-c9ed-4f41-a539-bea6839f9137.209db16f-5ade-4736-96a7-2f5456f6a18b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3680.14605254180386304.35eb8b6a-3db7-4fc4-a1ef-8fce19410457.1dc16400-916e-420f-895c-b8357ffcb8eb","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42921.14605254180386304.35eb8b6a-3db7-4fc4-a1ef-8fce19410457.3563ca38-5d84-4b4a-aede-ee33390cd09d","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35425.14605254180386304.843c17b3-dc76-4d90-b085-3171543de82c.b0c5b016-7d01-45bd-9a6b-33637a78b148","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9667.14605254180386304.843c17b3-dc76-4d90-b085-3171543de82c.6ffcb8c0-96c7-48a2-a493-a66d41f5b902","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28143.14605254180386304.843c17b3-dc76-4d90-b085-3171543de82c.377e2439-9914-4f7f-9ae5-c9208dc846e8","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45864.14605254180386304.843c17b3-dc76-4d90-b085-3171543de82c.8c20204a-3989-44e9-a175-13d4b774b2ba","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45550.14605254180386304.843c17b3-dc76-4d90-b085-3171543de82c.face4e8f-9437-40ea-bfd2-b7ab7f914b1e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33845.14605254180386304.843c17b3-dc76-4d90-b085-3171543de82c.b0f681aa-2442-41d7-896f-cafc556caab0","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6584.14605254180386304.843c17b3-dc76-4d90-b085-3171543de82c.5547e774-fdc5-4912-ac9e-b1bdda88dc84","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41479.14605254180386304.843c17b3-dc76-4d90-b085-3171543de82c.cc70161a-9d93-4b16-97a0-06618a0c4e34","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.631.14605254180386304.843c17b3-dc76-4d90-b085-3171543de82c.cb7c4741-851f-48d0-82e3-4243b454b53d","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17694.14605254180386304.843c17b3-dc76-4d90-b085-3171543de82c.19aa221d-a1a1-48b3-b210-209709ca222f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58430.14605254180386304.843c17b3-dc76-4d90-b085-3171543de82c.1935deb8-e357-45d8-8f77-420018d2fe16","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26990.14605254180386304.843c17b3-dc76-4d90-b085-3171543de82c.903cec5f-e7f1-41f5-9705-b80d0f256940","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37258.14605254180386304.843c17b3-dc76-4d90-b085-3171543de82c.15c49bda-9f2d-4dc3-8aa8-5b78f76a1b79","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49186.14605254180386304.8d335e73-c1ff-4541-8e67-52c9f889378b.e1fa074f-2cf8-4698-b6e8-cb2bb1221eed","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19956.14605254180386304.35eb8b6a-3db7-4fc4-a1ef-8fce19410457.5c7c2f0b-3e6f-40a5-8aa4-ab4704c7445a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48430.14605254180386304.35eb8b6a-3db7-4fc4-a1ef-8fce19410457.d4588047-55ec-4275-9159-c8b143e19269","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28355.14605254180386304.35eb8b6a-3db7-4fc4-a1ef-8fce19410457.63a6ca4a-ed79-4dc9-80a8-322ace354224","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32862.14605254180386304.35eb8b6a-3db7-4fc4-a1ef-8fce19410457.51cbf430-ed5d-4afb-9638-7ecdaa39f037","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42203.14605254180386304.35eb8b6a-3db7-4fc4-a1ef-8fce19410457.1bb2bfea-909d-4cef-9729-e442c61546cd"],"ReleaseDate":5248760702427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":7563460608}},{"Categories":["Shooter"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/shadow-warrior-2/"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":78},"ID":"BP79KKVGDDH1","Title":{"en-us":"Shadow Warrior 2"},"Description":{"en-us":"Shadow Warrior 2 is the stunning evolution of Flying Wild Hog’s offbeat first-person shooter following the further misadventures of former corporate shogun Lo Wang.

This narratively-driven single player game puts you in the role of a Jedi Padawan who narrowly escaped the purge of Order 66 following the events of Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith. On a quest to rebuild the Jedi Order, you must pick up the pieces of your shattered past to complete your training, develop new powerful Force abilities, and master the art of the iconic lightsaber - all while staying one step ahead of the Empire and its deadly Inquisitors. \r\n\r\nWhile mastering your abilities, players will engage in cinematically-charged lightsaber and Force combat designed to deliver the kind of intense STAR WARS lightsaber battles as seen in the films. Players will need to approach enemies strategically, sizing up strengths and weaknesses while cleverly utilizing your Jedi training to overcome your opponents and solve the mysteries that lay in your path. \r\n\r\nSTAR WARS fans will recognize iconic locations, weapons, gear, and enemies while also meeting a roster of fresh characters, locations, creatures, droids and adversaries new to STAR WARS. As part of this authentic STAR WARS story, fans will delve into a galaxy recently seized by the Empire. As a Jedi hero-turned-fugitive, players will need to fight for survival while exploring the mysteries of a long-extinct civilization all in an effort to rebuild the remnants of the Jedi Order as the Empire seeks to erase the Jedi completely.\r\n\r\nKEY FEATURES\r\n\r\n● Cinematic, Immersive Combat – Jedi: Fallen Order delivers the fantasy of becoming a Jedi through its innovative lightsaber combat system – striking, parrying, dodging - partnered with a suite of powerful Force abilities you’ll need to leverage to overcome obstacles that stand in your way. This combat system is intuitive to pick up, but takes training and practice to fully master its nuances as you gain new powers and abilities along your adventure.\r\n\r\n● A New Jedi Story Begins - As a former Padawan on the run from the Empire, you must complete your training before Imperial Inquisitors discover your plan to revive the Jedi Order. Aided by a former Jedi Knight, a cantankerous pilot, and a fearless droid, you must escape the evil machinations of the Empire in a story-driven adventure. Explore and overcome a wide range of challenges focused on combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving. \r\n\r\n● The Galaxy Awaits - Ancient forests, windswept rock faces, and haunted jungles are all unique biomes you’ll explore in Jedi: Fallen Order, with the freedom to decide when and where you go next. As you unlock new powers and abilities, opportunities open up to re-traverse maps in new ways; leveraging the Force to augment the way you explore. Move quickly, however, as the Empire is actively hunting your every step in their effort to exterminate all remnants of the Jedi Order.\r\n\r\nConditions and restrictions apply.

In this corrupt gambler’s paradise, the stakes are high and The House always wins. Play a varied and challenging world of events as Tyler; the Racer, Mac; the Showman and Jess; the Wheelman. Each driver must take on races, missions and challenges to earn the respect of the Valley’s underground and compete in the ultimate race to finally take down The House. \r\n\r\nYour car is at the centre of everything you do. Craft unique rides with deeper performance and visual customization than ever before. Push them to the limit when you narrowly escape the heat in epic cop battles. Go head-to-head with other racers on or off-road through canyons, deserts, mountains, and the city. Raise the stakes by putting down additional in-game currency on all events, challenges and missions that can multiply your winnings. But you could lose it all. Finally, for ultimate bragging rights, connect and compete via Autolog recommendations with your friends and, for the first time, with potential rivals. Your leaderboard will populate with other players of similar skill level so you can see how you rank around the world.\r\n\r\nFrom insane heist missions to devastating car battles to jaw dropping set piece moments, Need for Speed™ Payback delivers an edge of your seat, adrenaline-fueled action-driving fantasy.\r\n \r\nKEY FEATURES\r\n• Scrap to Stock to Supercar: Your car is at the centre of everything you do in Need for Speed Payback.

Find abandoned derelict cars scattered throughout the world to build your perfect car from the ground up. Collect, win, or buy the hottest after-market parts and craft multiple cars into the perfect driving machines.\r\n\r\n• Live out an action-driving fantasy: Play through an explosive, action-packed adventure as three distinct playable characters united by one common goal: revenge. Tyler, Mac and Jess team up to even the score against all odds, and enter the ultimate race to take down The House. Battle cops with ever-increasing intensity, race against rivals across the city, and drive on and off-road through mountains, canyons, and desert.\r\n\r\n•High stakes competition: Get on a roll and win big with all-new Risk vs Reward gameplay. The return of intense cop chases means the stakes have never been higher. Put your reputation on the line and challenge your friends or potential rivals via Autolog recommendations throughout the campaign events or go head-to-head in classic online leaderboards.\r\n\r\nConditions and restrictions apply.

Featuring unlimited item synergies and a unique dungeon evolution system, each run diversifies the experience and every choice alters the ruleset. Get ready to unleash hell!\r\n\r\nAbout the game\r\nCombining furious run ‘n’ gun action and deep, roguelike mechanics, Neon Abyss pits you as a member of the ‘Grim Squad’ – a task force set-up by Hades himself to infiltrate the Abyss and defeat the New Gods. Death is not the end as every time you die, you’ll find yourself more empowered than before.\r\n\r\nEvolving Dungeon\r\nWith each run, you will be able to unlock new rooms, items, bosses, special rules and even new endings!

The body count rises, and the police are no closer to catching the culprit. You are a taxi driver and survivor to the killer’s most recent attacks, having barely escaped with your life. You have seven nights to help find the killer, or the police will pin it on you. These next few shifts will be far from ordinary or safe…\r\n\r\nNight Call is a narrative-driven noire investigation game. You are no detective, but you do have a gift. Around you, people feel more at ease. They talk. They share their thoughts, their emotions, their stories… their secrets. To passengers, you are more than just a driver; you are also a friend, a confidant, a shrink. A voyeur catching a glimpse under the masked but very real lives throughout the City of Light. And you’ll need to play these roles well if you want to catch the killer.\r\n\r\nUse the limited time you have available each night to gather clues while earning money to pay your bills.

Barely.\r\n\r\nTake on the role of a powerful leader and mystic. Empowered with the gifts of technopathy, the ability to sense and affect electrical currents. \r\n\r\nYou are the last hope to a band of outcastes and refugees. Lead them across the randomly generated wastelands. Pick fights with greedy slavers and crazy machines using the turn-based card combat. Can you survive long enough to reach the mysterious Crypt?\r\n\r\nNowhere Prophet is a single player card game with procedurally generated maps, a high difficulty and permadeath. At it's heart are two distinct parts of gameplay: Travel and combat.\r\n\r\nDuring travel you navigate across a procedurally generated map. Make sure your convoy has enough resources to travel as you pick your route. On your journey you will encounter strange places and even stranger people. You will be thrust into situations that put the fate of your followers in your hands. \r\n\r\nIf you're lucky enough to gain some rewards, maybe for helping someone - or robbing them, then you can invest those to improve your decks. Recruit more followers to have more and different units to put into battle. Equip your prophet or level up and learn new skills to have access to stronger action cards in combat.\r\n\r\nYou will have to overcome some enemies to keep your convoy and resources together. And sometimes you may even want to pick a fight for righteousness or just for loot. Once in battle the game changes to the turn-based card game mode. \r\n\r\nPlay convoy cards to put your followers onto the field and position them so you can overcome your enemy. Or play action cards to dramatically change the battlefield. But be careful: If you're wounded you will have to find a safe place to heal. And if one of your followers takes too many wounds, they are lost forever.\r\n\r\n\r\nNowhere Prophet is set on a far off planet called Soma. Your story begins many years after the Crash, a complete technological collapse. Civilization has broken down and the lack of resources made everyone turn either bandit or madman.\r\n\r\nIn this world inspired by Indian culture you lead a convoy of outcastes. These desperate men and woman following your vision of a better future. Under your guidance they travel with you through the wastelands. Your goal is the Crypt, a mystical place that promises untainted technology and safety. \r\n\r\nIf you can survive long enough to find it."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"nowhere-prophet","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32015.14465196299932863.0fad387d-499a-4f06-b7ee-5b9e30e54212.f8c18113-775c-4518-b5b7-3e7003617035","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48227.14465196299932863.0fad387d-499a-4f06-b7ee-5b9e30e54212.154b4b53-2c84-4b68-9d07-6e3315dd6a99","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37012.14465196299932863.0fad387d-499a-4f06-b7ee-5b9e30e54212.d6a0885b-ac39-473d-9f26-9d51a159c6a0","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29669.14465196299932863.0fad387d-499a-4f06-b7ee-5b9e30e54212.e40e6c64-a542-4101-969e-fbcd83b37253","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28098.14465196299932863.0fad387d-499a-4f06-b7ee-5b9e30e54212.6d6bf54f-3986-4671-a3fc-ffeebc700d68","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32064.14465196299932863.0fad387d-499a-4f06-b7ee-5b9e30e54212.6bbe106a-b6c0-4200-8920-46883329ec8b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11999.14465196299932863.0fad387d-499a-4f06-b7ee-5b9e30e54212.92151f50-79e9-4a67-92eb-a33cedc6371c"],"ReleaseDate":5249001794427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":857665536}},{"Categories":["Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/observation/"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":79},"ID":"9PBLH1322GX0","Title":{"en":"Observation"},"Description":{"en":"Observation is a sci-fi thriller uncovering what happened to Dr. Emma Fisher, and the crew of her mission, through the lens of the station’s artificial intelligence S.A.M.

The town is dying. Face the realities of a collapsing society as you make difficult choices in seemingly lose-lose situations. The plague isn’t just a disease. You can’t save everyone.\r\n\r\nThe plague is devouring the town. The chief local healer is dead, and you are now to take his place. You’ll have to look for unexpected allies. The local kids are hiding something. Try playing by their rules.\r\n\r\nYou only have 12 days.\r\n\r\n- 12 days in an odd town ravaged by a deadly disease.\r\n- Time is of the essence: if you don’t manage it carefully, it’ll simply run out. You’ll have to choose how to spend the priceless minutes you have.\r\n- Survival thriller. You’ll have to manage your bodily functions, offsetting hunger, thirst, exhaustion, and so on. It doesn’t boil down to scavenging resources. Surviving on your own is hard; you’ll have to win over allies.\r\n- An uphill battle. Managing your bodily parameters may seem bearable at first, and as time goes by, it becomes harder and harder. Your own body is only waiting for an opportunity to give up and betray you. Things are changing from bad to worse and the odds are stacked against you.\r\n- A duel with an enemy you can’t kill. Your main foe is the plague itself, an incorporeal and malevolent entity that you have to defeat… without having the means to.

Your task is to lead the rag-tag Void Bastards out of the Sargasso Nebula. You make the decisions: where to go, what to do and who to fight. And then you must carry out that strategy in the face of strange and terrible enemies.\r\n\r\nOn board derelict spaceships you’ll plan your mission, taking note of the ship layout, what hazards and enemies you might encounter and what terminals and other ship systems you can use to your advantage...\r\n\r\nMove carefully through the dangerous ships, searching for supplies and manipulating control systems. React to what you find - will you detour to the generator to bring the power back online or will you fight your way into the security module to disable the ship’s defenses? Choose carefully when to fight, when to run and when just to be a bastard.\r\n\r\nUse your hard won supplies to improvise tools and weapons, from the distracting robo-kitty to the horribly unstable clusterflak.\r\n\r\nNavigate your tiny escape pod through the vast nebula. Flee from void whales and pirates, and politely avoid the hungry hermits. All the while you must keep scavenging for the food, fuel, and other resources that keep you alive.\r\n\r\nVoid Bastards features a 12-15 hour campaign that you can complete with an endless supply of prisoners, each with their own unique traits. When one dies, another steps forward to carry on the fight. Don’t worry though, as any crafting progress you’ve made is retained from one to another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"void-bastards","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18409.14220840565943461.66070e1d-a37b-4a3f-9fd0-f7314ce132cf.c41876f1-3c79-467c-ba55-ec3976b6fbee","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29317.13972576022022940.27aadd36-9e41-42c9-87a5-b24f1498ce63.f51e2a7d-695e-42a4-a64c-922a38bd9a54","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37502.13972576022022940.27aadd36-9e41-42c9-87a5-b24f1498ce63.eefa15e8-8c28-4181-b354-b42ec33978ee","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26824.13972576022022940.27aadd36-9e41-42c9-87a5-b24f1498ce63.292f40ed-21d2-440a-8016-5719e1c3a261","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8231.13972576022022940.27aadd36-9e41-42c9-87a5-b24f1498ce63.b374f902-8a9e-4cca-b6c8-91f45aa53318","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59199.13972576022022940.27aadd36-9e41-42c9-87a5-b24f1498ce63.8310044e-d615-420a-897e-a8c123fe70b1","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53866.13972576022022940.27aadd36-9e41-42c9-87a5-b24f1498ce63.4c6c410b-8281-4d76-ac85-91fc6f62bc3b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54563.13972576022022940.27aadd36-9e41-42c9-87a5-b24f1498ce63.b6294b39-7904-4799-b261-d8d76f0516c3","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17476.13972576022022940.27aadd36-9e41-42c9-87a5-b24f1498ce63.02655084-ac59-4fc4-ba94-b3685f427dfa"],"ReleaseDate":5248633010427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":6123126784}},{"Categories":["Strategy"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/wargroove/"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":81},"ID":"9NRPTTJ94PCK","Title":{"en-us":"Wargroove"},"Description":{"en-us":"Take to the battlefield with Wargroove, a strategy game for up to 4 players!

Saving Colorado isn't going to be easy, but Arizona is counting on you, so... don't screw it up."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"wasteland-3","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54134.69010346493633739.074410cb-38ab-4f48-b6fe-0ffa69c89fa9.5e0b834f-57d5-42d6-9b07-c8d7bf92038a","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44447.69010346493633739.074410cb-38ab-4f48-b6fe-0ffa69c89fa9.fa83f393-10ba-49cc-890c-809a516160b5","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55727.69010346493633739.074410cb-38ab-4f48-b6fe-0ffa69c89fa9.165fbe23-80d9-4718-8f2b-47f8688caf1e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33330.69010346493633739.074410cb-38ab-4f48-b6fe-0ffa69c89fa9.ca10c11c-0e57-4fce-a857-f55cba778d50","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1644.69010346493633739.074410cb-38ab-4f48-b6fe-0ffa69c89fa9.869f5b52-9ac9-451c-9055-fba19ca4a184","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40344.69010346493633739.074410cb-38ab-4f48-b6fe-0ffa69c89fa9.23d3a1dd-0dcc-4ea4-a35d-68e6f91a1b3e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57671.69010346493633739.074410cb-38ab-4f48-b6fe-0ffa69c89fa9.68e2d4b8-5c2c-4586-89e1-e54dd2f0ca12"],"ReleaseDate":5249027714427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":10616832}},{"Categories":["Classics","Role playing","Strategy"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/wasteland-remastered/"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":62},"ID":"9NGH1FK0RJGL","Title":{"en":"Wasteland Remastered"},"Description":{"en":"Originally released in 1988, Wasteland brought the post-apocalypse to video games and inspired a genre.

It has been compared to an old-school skating game, except instead of being a skater, you're a goat, and instead of doing tricks, you wreck stuff. Destroy things with style, such as doing a backflip while headbutting a bucket through a window, and you'll earn even more points! When it comes to goats, not even the sky is the limit, as you can probably just bug through it and crash the game.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer\r\nGoat Simulator is a completely stupid game and, to be honest, you should probably spend your money on something else, such as a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a real goat.\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n• You can be a goat \r\n• Get points for wrecking stuff - brag to your friends that you're the alpha goat \r\n• MILLIONS OF BUGS!

And now with Xbox One X, players can experience enhanced visuals, up to 4K resolution, increased visual details, and improved graphic fidelity that makes the game look better than ever before, all while maintaining a consistent 60FPS for the smoothest gameplay possible.\r\n\r\nEPIC CAMPAIGN\r\nThe Master Chief saga continues, with solo and up to 4-player cooperative experience that spans three worlds. A mysterious and unstoppable force threatens the galaxy. The Spartans of Fireteam Osiris and Blue Team must embark on a journey that will change the course of history and the future of mankind.\r\n\r\nWARZONE MULTIPLAYER\r\nPlay with friends and compete against rivals in three massive multiplayer modes new to the Halo franchise: Warzone, Warzone Assault, and Warzone Firefight. \r\n\r\n-WARZONE is a massive-scale multiplayer mode that supports 24-player battles with both friendly and enemy AI constantly dropping in to mix up the experience. \r\n\r\n-In WARZONE ASSAULT, it’s 24-player attack-and-defend with the attacking team looking to overrun strategic objectives while the opposing force works to stop the onslaught. \r\n\r\n-WARZONE FIREFIGHT is an ambitious new multiplayer experience that delivers the biggest Halo cooperative experience in franchise history. Up to eight players work together to complete five rounds of increasingly difficult, dynamic objectives set against a timer to emerge victorious.\r\n\r\nARENA MULTIPLAYER\r\nHalo 5’s Arena multiplayer continues the established franchise legacy of pure, skill-based 4v4 competitive combat. Multiple Arena modes provide endless ways to play and compete, from classic Slayer and Capture The Flag modes, to popular social modes like Infection, Grifball, and the all-new Super Fiesta.\r\n\r\nFORGE\r\nFor years, Halo’s Forge mode has empowered Halo fans to create new maps and game modes that have changed the way people play and experience Halo. Download new levels from the Forge community created on either Windows (using “Halo 5: Forge” for Windows 10) or Xbox One. Customize existing maps or create your own from scratch. Browse, find, and play an endless array of custom games created and hosted by the community.\r\n\r\nREQ SYSTEM\r\nNew to Halo 5: Guardians is the Requisition System (REQ System), which rewards players for their time spent in Halo 5’s multiplayer modes. Players will earn REQ Points after each match in Arena or Warzone which can then be used to purchase REQ Packs containing a variety of REQ items in the form of unlockable weapons, armors, vehicles, stances, assassinations, and more!\r\n\r\nPHOTOSENSITIVITY SEIZURE WARNING: A very small percentage of people may experience a seizure when exposed to certain visual images, including flashing lights or patterns that may appear in video games.

The time has come to stake your claim on the Red Planet and build the first functioning human colonies on Mars!  All you need are supplies, oxygen, decades of training, experience with sandstorms, and a can-do attitude to discover the purpose of those weird black cubes that appeared out of nowhere. With a bit of sprucing up, this place is going to be awesome! \r\n \r\nSurviving Mars is a sci-fi city builder all about colonizing Mars and surviving the process. Choose a space agency for resources and financial support before determining a location for your colony. Build domes and infrastructure, research new possibilities and utilize drones to unlock more elaborate ways to shape and expand your settlement. Cultivate your own food, mine minerals or just relax by the bar after a hard day’s work. Most important of all, though, is keeping your colonists alive. Not an easy task on a strange new planet.\r\n \r\nThere will be challenges to overcome. Execute your strategy and improve your colony’s chances of survival while unlocking the mysteries of this alien world. Are you ready? Mars is waiting for you.\r\n \r\nMain Features:\r\n\r\n· Building a sustainable colony in space: Building on a planet not fit for human life challenges you to build a smart, functional colony. Bad planning isn’t about traffic jams, it’s about survival of your colonists. You really don’t want rolling blackouts in a city constructed in a place without oxygen.\r\n \r\n· Individually simulated colonists: Each colonist is a unique individual with problems and strengths that influence the needs and behavior of the other colonists. Things can get really interesting if your chief scientists develops alcoholism after one too many long nights in the lab.\r\n \r\n· Futuristic Space Dome construction: Retro-futuristic super structures housing colonists, factories and commercial buildings with their own “neighborhood personality.” Create colonies that value science over everything else, while tired workers drink their pay away at a local bar, or attempt a utopia among the stars. \r\n \r\n· Exploration of Mars’ secrets:  Inspired by the classic sci-fi of Asimov and Clarke, Surviving Mars holds many secrets. During each playthrough players may encounter one of Mars’ individually crafted mysteries. Uncovering these secrets might bring your colony great fortune, or terrible ruin. \r\n \r\n\r\n· Randomized research tree: Combine static and random research through exploration, which allows for a different experience for each journey through the game. Attain new scientific breakthroughs by exploring the uncharted terrain of Mars's surface.\r\n\r\n· Unique retro-futuristic aesthetic: A sleek, modern take on the bright futurism of the 1960s. A time of exploration and adventure."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"surviving-mars","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29809.13897576008709751.2a03398b-a338-415b-b860-375a94472e34.70982d73-0f9f-4ad8-a928-23f7491dc7f6","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7296.13897576008709751.79361d33-7a18-4554-8a50-66b60d3712e6.795f9cfd-d44e-4cf7-94e6-e64e577c4509","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61796.13897576008709751.79361d33-7a18-4554-8a50-66b60d3712e6.840a5e17-49ad-4924-a150-7c65c76623da","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24027.13897576008709751.79361d33-7a18-4554-8a50-66b60d3712e6.3fddc94d-80b8-4d30-ac9a-3bb0eb45aedc","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35595.13897576008709751.79361d33-7a18-4554-8a50-66b60d3712e6.b8277a9b-da5f-4fa9-a2dd-b69f1667516e"],"ReleaseDate":5248252706427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":6876598272}},{"Categories":["Action & adventure","Role playing"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/sword-art-online-fatal-bullet/"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":72},"ID":"BWH56DK175P1","Title":{"en-us":"SWORD ART ONLINE: FATAL BULLET"},"Description":{"en-us":"Your choices are heavier and faster than a bullet.\r\nNow YOU are the protagonist of your own TPSRPG.

Hack’n’slash through hordes of enemies in procedurally generated dungeons, caves and lands and lead the family of Bergsons, with all their flaws and virtues, against the forthcoming Corruption.\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n\r\nGAMEPLAY\r\nGameplay-wise it's a unique mix of action-adventure RPG, rogue-lite and hack and slash game. By leveling up, you develop not only individual characters but also the entire family. There is no permadeath and you can change family members between the dungeon runs. \r\n\r\nLOCAL CO-OP\r\nPlay as two Bergsons together against the Corruption! Additional controller required. (Online co-op to be added in the future)\r\n\r\nSTORY\r\nThe story takes place in a distant land but copes with themes and emotions common to all of us: love and hope, longing and uncertainty, ultimately loss... and sacrifice we are willing to make to save the ones we care the most for. Ultimately, it's about a family of heroes standing against the encroaching darkness.\r\n\r\nDUNGEON CRAWLING\r\nAll the dungeons in the game are procedurally generated, which means their layout is different with each adventure. There can be from two to four levels of each dungeon, with a unique boss fight at the end. You can always get back to the previous dungeons to get extra XP or finish all the side quests.\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS & SKILLS\r\nRanged attacks, magic spells, blocks, stuns, healing, evasions and passive skills - it's all there for you to discover, unlock and upgrade.
