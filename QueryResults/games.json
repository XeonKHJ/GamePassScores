      "en-us": "Cities: Skylines – Xbox One Edition puts you in charge of a growing city – from the ground-breaking of its first streets to the ever-changing needs of thousands of citizens. Design, build, and manage the city of your dreams, from public services to civic policies, and challenge yourself to grow from a simple town to a bustling metropolitan hub.\r\nCities: Skylines is an award-winning, best-selling management game, now available for the Xbox One with all of its robust city-simulation gameplay and unique charm along for the ride. The Xbox One Edition includes the base game and the popular After Dark expansion, allowing players to plan and design for their cities’ nightlife and tourist attractions.\r\n\r\nMain Features:\r\nBuild the city of your dreams: Plan road networks, bus lines and parks. Bring on a smog-filled industrial revolution or create a quiet beach town ideal for tourists powered by renewable energy. Bring education, healthcare and safety to your citizens. Build it your way!\r\n\r\nMulti-tiered and challenging simulation: Playing as the mayor of your city, you’ll be faced with balancing essential requirements such as education, water electricity, police, firefighting, healthcare and much more, along with your city’s economy. Citizens within your city react fluidly, keeping you on your toes with ever-evolving demands.\r\n\r\nExtensive local traffic simulation: Managing traffic and the needs of your citizens to work and play will require the use of several interactive transport systems – use careful road planning alongside buses, trains, subways, and much more.\r\n\r\nDistricts and policies: Be more than just another city hall official! Create a car-free downtown area, assign free public transport to your waterfront, or ban pets in suburbia. Designate parts of your city as a district in order to set policy at the local level, and give different parts of town their own personalities.\r\n\r\nAfter Dark included: Watch your city become an entirely different place at night: a day-night cycle will have your citizens seeking out places to unwind after work. Add in new policies and zones to create popular hotspots and provide enough taxis and trains to get to and from the clubs!"

A large variety of swords, bows and of course spells, but also whips, grenades and turrets, each one with its own unique twist. Plus, mutations and scrolls allow you to build and customize your character differently with each and every run.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day though, it’s YOUR skills as a player that matter most! Roguelites are about constantly sharpening your skills, until what was an insurmountable obstacle becomes a walk in the park. Patience, you’ll get better!… eventually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\nRogueVania: The progressive exploration of an interconnected world, with the replayability of a rogue-lite and the adrenaline pumping threat of permadeath.\r\n\r\n2D Souls-lite Action: Tough but fair combat, the iconic dodge roll, more than 90 weapons and spells with unique gameplay… The unforgiving action wed to the absence of any kind of safety net makes for an adrenalin pumping ride each and every run. \r\n\r\nNonlinear progression: Sewers, Ossuary or Ramparts? Once unlocked, special permanent abilities allow you to access new paths to reach your objective. Opt for the path that suits your current build, your play style, or just your mood.\r\n\r\nExploration: Secret rooms, hidden passages, charming landscapes.

Now, after ten years, she has finally secured her release—yet she still bears the heavy psychological burden of that tragic event. With her mind in tatters, she is unable to resolve the fear prompted by her strange memories, dreams, and visions. Perhaps she’ll do better in Wonderland. She always has. She travels there, seeking what the “real” world can’t provide: security, knowledge, and the truth about the past. But in her absence, Wonderland too has suffered. Something has gone horribly wrong, and now a great evil is descending upon what once was her beautiful refuge. Can Alice save Wonderland—and herself—from the madness that consumes them both?"

Customize and decorate your bases, vehicles, and Astroneer.\r\n\r\n•••4 Player co-op•••\r\nAstroneer is better with friends. Group up with other players and work together to create massive industrial bases or to create fun games in the extensive creative sandbox. \r\n\r\n•••Survive & harness the power of the planets•••\r\nOnce Astroneers are ready, they may choose to attempt to understand and possibly harness the power behind mysterious structures found in the world.\r\n\r\nAstroneer began as a Game Preview title and would not be here today if not for your support, feedback, and ideas throughout that process. Now that we have hit 1.0 we will keep our pledge to continue building on the foundation that is Astroneer with free, ongoing content updates.

Build gardens to provide them with food, wells for water, and yoga balls and puppet shows to keep them entertained. You can even craft treadmills and solar panels to generate power for Tesla coils, electric fences, and other fortifications.\r\n\r\nYou’ll need robust defenses, as you’ll quickly see that The Drakes aren’t the only residents of The Hollow. The Feral have overrun the land, evil creatures that are looking to shred anything happy or good. Battle them one-on-one with a wide array of weapons ranging from tennis rackets to nail guns, bring your friends to lend a hand, and build your defenses so you can take them out without lifting a finger.\r\n\r\nTravel from region to region, season to season, taking the Drakes and their village with you. Each region is over a square mile of territory to explore, dynamically generated and populated with each passing season.\r\n\r\nYou must balance your time carefully. What supplies are most crucial at any given moment? What does your village need? Metal from the supply caches to build your defenses, or crystals from the blighted regions to grow your Drakes? Prove that you’ve got what it takes to help the Drakes and take back The Hollow."

      "en-us": "A galaxy-spanning adventure awaits in STAR WARS Jedi: Fallen Order, a new 3rd person action-adventure title from Respawn Entertainment. This narratively-driven single player game puts you in the role of a Jedi Padawan who narrowly escaped the purge of Order 66 following the events of Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith. On a quest to rebuild the Jedi Order, you must pick up the pieces of your shattered past to complete your training, develop new powerful Force abilities, and master the art of the iconic lightsaber - all while staying one step ahead of the Empire and its deadly Inquisitors. \r\n\r\nWhile mastering your abilities, players will engage in cinematically-charged lightsaber and Force combat designed to deliver the kind of intense STAR WARS lightsaber battles as seen in the films. Players will need to approach enemies strategically, sizing up strengths and weaknesses while cleverly utilizing your Jedi training to overcome your opponents and solve the mysteries that lay in your path. \r\n\r\nSTAR WARS fans will recognize iconic locations, weapons, gear, and enemies while also meeting a roster of fresh characters, locations, creatures, droids and adversaries new to STAR WARS. As part of this authentic STAR WARS story, fans will delve into a galaxy recently seized by the Empire. As a Jedi hero-turned-fugitive, players will need to fight for survival while exploring the mysteries of a long-extinct civilization all in an effort to rebuild the remnants of the Jedi Order as the Empire seeks to erase the Jedi completely.\r\n\r\nKEY FEATURES\r\n\r\n● Cinematic, Immersive Combat – Jedi: Fallen Order delivers the fantasy of becoming a Jedi through its innovative lightsaber combat system – striking, parrying, dodging - partnered with a suite of powerful Force abilities you’ll need to leverage to overcome obstacles that stand in your way. This combat system is intuitive to pick up, but takes training and practice to fully master its nuances as you gain new powers and abilities along your adventure.\r\n\r\n● A New Jedi Story Begins - As a former Padawan on the run from the Empire, you must complete your training before Imperial Inquisitors discover your plan to revive the Jedi Order. Aided by a former Jedi Knight, a cantankerous pilot, and a fearless droid, you must escape the evil machinations of the Empire in a story-driven adventure. Explore and overcome a wide range of challenges focused on combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving. \r\n\r\n● The Galaxy Awaits - Ancient forests, windswept rock faces, and haunted jungles are all unique biomes you’ll explore in Jedi: Fallen Order, with the freedom to decide when and where you go next. As you unlock new powers and abilities, opportunities open up to re-traverse maps in new ways; leveraging the Force to augment the way you explore. Move quickly, however, as the Empire is actively hunting your every step in their effort to exterminate all remnants of the Jedi Order.\r\n\r\nConditions and restrictions apply.

      "en-us": "No Man’s Sky comes complete with all 12 major updates up to and including Origins, our 3.0 update which dramatically expands the universe.\r\n\r\nInspired by the adventure and imagination that we love from classic science-fiction, No Man's Sky presents you with a galaxy to explore, filled with unique planets and lifeforms, and constant danger and action.\r\n\r\nIn No Man's Sky, every star is the light of a distant sun, each orbited by planets filled with life, and you can go to any of them you choose. Fly smoothly from deep space to planetary surfaces, with no loading screens, and no limits. In this infinite procedurally generated universe, you'll discover places and creatures that no other players have seen before - and perhaps never will again.\r\n\r\nEmbark on an epic voyage\r\nAt the centre of the galaxy lies a irresistible pulse which draws you on a journey towards it to learn the true nature of the cosmos. But, facing hostile creatures and fierce pirates, you'll know that death comes at a cost, and survival will be down to the choices you make over how you upgrade your ship, your weapon and suit.\r\n\r\nFind your own destiny\r\nYour voyage through No Man's Sky is up to you. Will you be a fighter, preying on the weak and taking their riches, or taking out pirates for their bounties? Power is yours if you upgrade your ship for speed and weaponry.\r\nOr a trader? Find rich resources on forgotten worlds and exploit them for the highest prices. Invest in more cargo space and you'll reap huge rewards.\r\nOr perhaps an explorer? Go beyond the known frontier and discover places and things that no one has ever seen before. Upgrade your engines to jump ever farther, and strengthen your suit for survival in toxic environments that would kill the unwary.\r\n\r\nShare your journey\r\nThe galaxy is a living, breathing place. Trade convoys travel between stars, factions vie for territory, pirates hunt the unwary, and the police are ever watching. Every other player lives in the same galaxy, and you can choose to share your discoveries with them on a map that spans known space. Perhaps you will see the results of their actions as well as your own..."

      "en": "Build a loyal band of followers and survive the journey across a broken world. Barely.\r\n\r\nTake on the role of a powerful leader and mystic. Empowered with the gifts of technopathy, the ability to sense and affect electrical currents. \r\n\r\nYou are the last hope to a band of outcastes and refugees. Lead them across the randomly generated wastelands. Pick fights with greedy slavers and crazy machines using the turn-based card combat. Can you survive long enough to reach the mysterious Crypt?\r\n\r\nNowhere Prophet is a single player card game with procedurally generated maps, a high difficulty and permadeath. At it's heart are two distinct parts of gameplay: Travel and combat.\r\n\r\nDuring travel you navigate across a procedurally generated map. Make sure your convoy has enough resources to travel as you pick your route. On your journey you will encounter strange places and even stranger people. You will be thrust into situations that put the fate of your followers in your hands. \r\n\r\nIf you're lucky enough to gain some rewards, maybe for helping someone - or robbing them, then you can invest those to improve your decks. Recruit more followers to have more and different units to put into battle. Equip your prophet or level up and learn new skills to have access to stronger action cards in combat.\r\n\r\nYou will have to overcome some enemies to keep your convoy and resources together. And sometimes you may even want to pick a fight for righteousness or just for loot. Once in battle the game changes to the turn-based card game mode. \r\n\r\nPlay convoy cards to put your followers onto the field and position them so you can overcome your enemy. Or play action cards to dramatically change the battlefield. But be careful: If you're wounded you will have to find a safe place to heal. And if one of your followers takes too many wounds, they are lost forever.\r\n\r\n\r\nNowhere Prophet is set on a far off planet called Soma. Your story begins many years after the Crash, a complete technological collapse. Civilization has broken down and the lack of resources made everyone turn either bandit or madman.\r\n\r\nIn this world inspired by Indian culture you lead a convoy of outcastes. These desperate men and woman following your vision of a better future. Under your guidance they travel with you through the wastelands. Your goal is the Crypt, a mystical place that promises untainted technology and safety. \r\n\r\nIf you can survive long enough to find it."

      "en": "Pathologic 2 is a narrative-driven dramatic thriller about fighting a deadly outbreak in a secluded rural town. The town is dying. Face the realities of a collapsing society as you make difficult choices in seemingly lose-lose situations. The plague isn’t just a disease. You can’t save everyone.\r\n\r\nThe plague is devouring the town. The chief local healer is dead, and you are now to take his place. You’ll have to look for unexpected allies. The local kids are hiding something. Try playing by their rules.\r\n\r\nYou only have 12 days.\r\n\r\n- 12 days in an odd town ravaged by a deadly disease.\r\n- Time is of the essence: if you don’t manage it carefully, it’ll simply run out. You’ll have to choose how to spend the priceless minutes you have.\r\n- Survival thriller. You’ll have to manage your bodily functions, offsetting hunger, thirst, exhaustion, and so on. It doesn’t boil down to scavenging resources. Surviving on your own is hard; you’ll have to win over allies.\r\n- An uphill battle. Managing your bodily parameters may seem bearable at first, and as time goes by, it becomes harder and harder. Your own body is only waiting for an opportunity to give up and betray you. Things are changing from bad to worse and the odds are stacked against you.\r\n- A duel with an enemy you can’t kill. Your main foe is the plague itself, an incorporeal and malevolent entity that you have to defeat… without having the means to. It’s more powerful and more treacherous than you can imagine.\r\n- Loot, murder, mug, steal, barter, beg… or don’t. You need resources to survive, and it’s up to you how to obtain them.\r\n- The fights are short, ungraceful, and vicious. They’re not always lethal though. Many people—yourself included—would prefer to exchange their wallet for their life."

Your task is to lead the rag-tag Void Bastards out of the Sargasso Nebula. You make the decisions: where to go, what to do and who to fight. And then you must carry out that strategy in the face of strange and terrible enemies.\r\n\r\nOn board derelict spaceships you’ll plan your mission, taking note of the ship layout, what hazards and enemies you might encounter and what terminals and other ship systems you can use to your advantage...\r\n\r\nMove carefully through the dangerous ships, searching for supplies and manipulating control systems. React to what you find - will you detour to the generator to bring the power back online or will you fight your way into the security module to disable the ship’s defenses? Choose carefully when to fight, when to run and when just to be a bastard.\r\n\r\nUse your hard won supplies to improvise tools and weapons, from the distracting robo-kitty to the horribly unstable clusterflak.\r\n\r\nNavigate your tiny escape pod through the vast nebula. Flee from void whales and pirates, and politely avoid the hungry hermits. All the while you must keep scavenging for the food, fuel, and other resources that keep you alive.\r\n\r\nVoid Bastards features a 12-15 hour campaign that you can complete with an endless supply of prisoners, each with their own unique traits. When one dies, another steps forward to carry on the fight. Don’t worry though, as any crafting progress you’ve made is retained from one to another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It has been compared to an old-school skating game, except instead of being a skater, you're a goat, and instead of doing tricks, you wreck stuff. Destroy things with style, such as doing a backflip while headbutting a bucket through a window, and you'll earn even more points! When it comes to goats, not even the sky is the limit, as you can probably just bug through it and crash the game.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer\r\nGoat Simulator is a completely stupid game and, to be honest, you should probably spend your money on something else, such as a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a real goat.\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n• You can be a goat \r\n• Get points for wrecking stuff - brag to your friends that you're the alpha goat \r\n• MILLIONS OF BUGS! We're only eliminating the crash-bugs, everything else is hilarious and we're keeping it \r\n• In-game physics that bug out all the time \r\n• Seriously look at that goat's neck \r\n• You can be a goat"

And now with Xbox One X, players can experience enhanced visuals, up to 4K resolution, increased visual details, and improved graphic fidelity that makes the game look better than ever before, all while maintaining a consistent 60FPS for the smoothest gameplay possible.\r\n\r\nEPIC CAMPAIGN\r\nThe Master Chief saga continues, with solo and up to 4-player cooperative experience that spans three worlds. A mysterious and unstoppable force threatens the galaxy. The Spartans of Fireteam Osiris and Blue Team must embark on a journey that will change the course of history and the future of mankind.\r\n\r\nWARZONE MULTIPLAYER\r\nPlay with friends and compete against rivals in three massive multiplayer modes new to the Halo franchise: Warzone, Warzone Assault, and Warzone Firefight. \r\n\r\n-WARZONE is a massive-scale multiplayer mode that supports 24-player battles with both friendly and enemy AI constantly dropping in to mix up the experience. \r\n\r\n-In WARZONE ASSAULT, it’s 24-player attack-and-defend with the attacking team looking to overrun strategic objectives while the opposing force works to stop the onslaught. \r\n\r\n-WARZONE FIREFIGHT is an ambitious new multiplayer experience that delivers the biggest Halo cooperative experience in franchise history. Up to eight players work together to complete five rounds of increasingly difficult, dynamic objectives set against a timer to emerge victorious.\r\n\r\nARENA MULTIPLAYER\r\nHalo 5’s Arena multiplayer continues the established franchise legacy of pure, skill-based 4v4 competitive combat. Multiple Arena modes provide endless ways to play and compete, from classic Slayer and Capture The Flag modes, to popular social modes like Infection, Grifball, and the all-new Super Fiesta.\r\n\r\nFORGE\r\nFor years, Halo’s Forge mode has empowered Halo fans to create new maps and game modes that have changed the way people play and experience Halo. Download new levels from the Forge community created on either Windows (using “Halo 5: Forge” for Windows 10) or Xbox One. Customize existing maps or create your own from scratch. Browse, find, and play an endless array of custom games created and hosted by the community.\r\n\r\nREQ SYSTEM\r\nNew to Halo 5: Guardians is the Requisition System (REQ System), which rewards players for their time spent in Halo 5’s multiplayer modes. Players will earn REQ Points after each match in Arena or Warzone which can then be used to purchase REQ Packs containing a variety of REQ items in the form of unlockable weapons, armors, vehicles, stances, assassinations, and more!\r\n\r\nPHOTOSENSITIVITY SEIZURE WARNING: A very small percentage of people may experience a seizure when exposed to certain visual images, including flashing lights or patterns that may appear in video games.

The time has come to stake your claim on the Red Planet and build the first functioning human colonies on Mars!  All you need are supplies, oxygen, decades of training, experience with sandstorms, and a can-do attitude to discover the purpose of those weird black cubes that appeared out of nowhere. With a bit of sprucing up, this place is going to be awesome! \r\n \r\nSurviving Mars is a sci-fi city builder all about colonizing Mars and surviving the process. Choose a space agency for resources and financial support before determining a location for your colony. Build domes and infrastructure, research new possibilities and utilize drones to unlock more elaborate ways to shape and expand your settlement. Cultivate your own food, mine minerals or just relax by the bar after a hard day’s work. Most important of all, though, is keeping your colonists alive. Not an easy task on a strange new planet.\r\n \r\nThere will be challenges to overcome. Execute your strategy and improve your colony’s chances of survival while unlocking the mysteries of this alien world. Are you ready? Mars is waiting for you.\r\n \r\nMain Features:\r\n\r\n· Building a sustainable colony in space: Building on a planet not fit for human life challenges you to build a smart, functional colony. Bad planning isn’t about traffic jams, it’s about survival of your colonists. You really don’t want rolling blackouts in a city constructed in a place without oxygen.\r\n \r\n· Individually simulated colonists: Each colonist is a unique individual with problems and strengths that influence the needs and behavior of the other colonists. Things can get really interesting if your chief scientists develops alcoholism after one too many long nights in the lab.\r\n \r\n· Futuristic Space Dome construction: Retro-futuristic super structures housing colonists, factories and commercial buildings with their own “neighborhood personality.” Create colonies that value science over everything else, while tired workers drink their pay away at a local bar, or attempt a utopia among the stars. \r\n \r\n· Exploration of Mars’ secrets:  Inspired by the classic sci-fi of Asimov and Clarke, Surviving Mars holds many secrets. During each playthrough players may encounter one of Mars’ individually crafted mysteries. Uncovering these secrets might bring your colony great fortune, or terrible ruin. \r\n \r\n\r\n· Randomized research tree: Combine static and random research through exploration, which allows for a different experience for each journey through the game. Attain new scientific breakthroughs by exploring the uncharted terrain of Mars's surface.\r\n\r\n· Unique retro-futuristic aesthetic: A sleek, modern take on the bright futurism of the 1960s. A time of exploration and adventure."

      "en-us": "IT RUNS IN THE FAMILY\r\n\r\nChildren of Morta is an action RPG with a rogue-lite approach to character development, where you don’t play a single character - but a whole, extraordinary family of heroes. Hack’n’slash through hordes of enemies in procedurally generated dungeons, caves and lands and lead the family of Bergsons, with all their flaws and virtues, against the forthcoming Corruption.\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n\r\nGAMEPLAY\r\nGameplay-wise it's a unique mix of action-adventure RPG, rogue-lite and hack and slash game. By leveling up, you develop not only individual characters but also the entire family. There is no permadeath and you can change family members between the dungeon runs. \r\n\r\nLOCAL CO-OP\r\nPlay as two Bergsons together against the Corruption! Additional controller required. (Online co-op to be added in the future)\r\n\r\nSTORY\r\nThe story takes place in a distant land but copes with themes and emotions common to all of us: love and hope, longing and uncertainty, ultimately loss... and sacrifice we are willing to make to save the ones we care the most for. Ultimately, it's about a family of heroes standing against the encroaching darkness.\r\n\r\nDUNGEON CRAWLING\r\nAll the dungeons in the game are procedurally generated, which means their layout is different with each adventure. There can be from two to four levels of each dungeon, with a unique boss fight at the end. You can always get back to the previous dungeons to get extra XP or finish all the side quests.\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS & SKILLS\r\nRanged attacks, magic spells, blocks, stuns, healing, evasions and passive skills - it's all there for you to discover, unlock and upgrade. You can choose from seven different family members, each one having unique skill sets. The father, John - a protective warrior with a sword and shield. The elder daughter Linda - a precise archer. Kevin, a quiet fighter equipped with deadly daggers. Lucy - a lively and bold fire mage. Mark - a mindful martial arts fighter. Joey - who smashes his enemies with a sledgehammer. And the latest addition to the family - Apan, a mighty healer and a firm defender in one.\r\n\r\nART STYLE\r\nA combination of hand painted pixel art and frame-by-frame animations partnered with modern lighting techniques come to life to create the beautifully dangerous world of Children of Morta!\r\n"

Your family is important too, and throughout your time as King, you will have to support them in their struggles.\r\n\r\nYou will face lords with a variety of personalities; you will need their support in order to win an upcoming battle, but some may ask you to perform dirty deeds to cement the alliance. One thing is clear: It won’t be easy to keep everyone happy...\r\n"
